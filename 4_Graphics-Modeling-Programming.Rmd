# This Week's Training Schedule
The trainings this week will introduce you to the R language as well as demonstrate common tasks during data analysis. We will begin today with an overview of the R language before moving on to importing/writing files, data manipulation, data visualization, modeling, and an introduction to R programming.

Whether the information we cover today is brand new or review, it's a good place to start as it forms the requisite knowledge for the concepts presented on Day 2 and Day 3- not to mention anything else you might want to explore with your knew skills in R.

**The ultimate goal of these trainings is to provide you with a solid foundation upon which you can continue to explore the language and further develop your skillset.**

))

```



# Visualizing Data with ggplot2
We'll be exploring another member of the **tidyverse** package family called **ggplot2** which uses a *grammar of graphics* in combination with other graphics packages to make visualizing data in R effortless.

This package has been widely adopted because of how easy it is to build attractive plots, especially once the structure is understood. It also has a rich set of features that are not as easy as (or available in) *base*:

- Easily create *plot objects* that can be saved and editted later
- Merge disparate datasets into the same plot
- Annotate and label plots easily, with several options for customization
- Add trend lines to a graph without first having to build a model
- Write plot images to your machine for use in other platforms
- Combine ggplot's grammar of graphics in the same code chunk as readr, stringr, dplyr, etc. operations
- And more! See the [ggplot2 online documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html)

**Note** as a member of the **tidyverse** family it can use the piping operator **%>%** to easily chain together lines of code.



# The Grammar of Graphics
The *grammar of graphics* is based upon a book of the same name by Leland Wilkinson, which describes an approach to data visualization through *layering* components together. The **ggplot2** package is designed based upon this approach. The *layers* used to build plots include: 

- **Data**: the information you wish to visualize, along with a set of **aesthetic** mappings which describe how variables *map* to visual attributes (i.e. size, color, etc.)
- **Layers**: what is actually displayed on the plot. This component is comprised of both **geoms** and **stats**- the first is the shape used for a plot, and the latter is a statistical summary
- **Scales**: define how data values are mapped into aesthetics (e.g. which colors to assign to each level of categorical variable). Scales also control the legends and axis on a plot
- **Coords**: controls how coordinates are mapped to a plane, as well as provides gridlines and axes
- **Facets**: a description of how to break up the data into subsets and display them as small multiples
- **Themes**: controls the general appearance of the visualization, from background color to font size. You can used either predefined themes, or create your own customized theme

**Note** it is worthwhile to spend some time reading *ggplot2* by Hadley Wickham as it goes into great detail on each of these layers and full demonstrates the level of customization in each.



# The ggplot2 Recipe
Using the *grammar of graphics* to build a plot is very convenient, and especially after some practice. The basic recipe for creating a plot with **ggplot2** follows the format below. While these are the most common, of course there are more/ different types of *layers* you can add to your plots (which is why you should read the documentation!)

```{r ggplot2_recipe, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# create the plot base, define your dataset and global aesthetic options
ggplot(...) +
    # add a geom layer to define how the data is represented visually
    geom_XXX(...) +
    # add a title to the plot
    ggtitle(...) +
    # change the theme to customize the appearance of your plot
    theme(...)
```


Using the **ggsave()** function, you can save a plot image to your machine. It takes two arguments, the name of a plot object and the file name you wish to write. If you don't pass the function an object, it will default to saving the last plot in memory.
```{r ggsave, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# assuming you have a plot object named "plt", you could save it explicity as a .PNG by
ggsave(plt, "filename.png")

# else, if you wanted to save the last plot in memory you could do the following
ggsave("filename.png")

```

# Common Geoms
<br></br>
There are many different options to choose from for the **geom** layer, and some of the most common are:

<center>*Fig 3.1: Common ggplot2 Geoms*</center>
<center>*Source: ggplot2 by Hadley Whickham (pg. 81)*</center>

<br></br>
Let's take a brief detour to the *ggplot2* website and go through the [full list of geom objects](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/).



# Common Aesthetics
<br></br>
The most commonly used aesthetics are:

- **x**: the data column to present on the x-axis
- **y**: the data column to present on the y-axis
- **Color**: the color of the geom (i.e. line, point, bar, etc.)
- **Fill**: the color of the fill for a geom where it applies (i.e. point, density)
- **Size**: the size of the geom
- **Shape**: the specific style of geom (i.e. filled point vs. hollow point)

<br></br>
To put these options into context, let's take another detour and look at some [aesthetic specifications](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html).



# Visualizing Data: bar chart
A bar chart can be created with the **geom_bar()** geom. If you have continuous data, you can create a histogram with the **geom_histogram()** geom (which uses a default of 30 bins).

```{r barchart, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = job, fill = td_enroll)) +
    geom_bar() + 
    ggtitle("Enrollment Outcome by Job Type") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5),
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```



# Try it!: Creating a bar-chart
Which of these code chunks would result in the plot below?

```{r barchart_ex, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = education, fill = job)) +
    geom_bar() + 
    ggtitle("Job Type by Education Level") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5),
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```



# Try it!: Creating a bar-chart (MC)
```{r barchart_try, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
### Option A
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = education, fill = td_enroll)) +
    geom_bar() + 
    ggtitle("Job Type by Education Level") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))

### Option B
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age_group)) +
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Records by Age Group") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

### Option C
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = education, fill = job)) +
    geom_bar() + 
    ggtitle("Job Type by Education Level") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5),
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

```



# Visualizing Data: Density Polygon
Another way to visualize a continuous distribution is with the **geom_density()** geom. This layer has a *smoothing* parameter you can adjust to make the curve more or less smooth.

```{r density, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = td_enroll, color = td_enroll)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.25) +
    ggtitle("Age Distributions by Enrollment Outcome") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

```



# Visualizing Data: box & whisker plot
Create a box and whisker plot with the **geom_boxplot()** geom.

```{r box_whisker, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = job, y = duration, fill = job)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    ggtitle("Age Distribution by Job Type") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5),
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
          legend.position = "none")

```



# Try it!: Creating a box & whisker plot
Which of these code chunks would result in the plot below?

```{r boxwhisker_ex, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = age)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = c("red", "blue", "green")) +
    ggtitle("Range of Age Groups") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

```



# Try it!: Creating a box & whisker plot (MC)
```{r boxwhisker_try, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
### Option A
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = age)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "blue") +
    ggtitle("Range of Age Groups") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

### Option B
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = age, fill = age_group)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    ggtitle("Range of Age Groups") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)) 

### Option C
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = age)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = c("red", "blue", "green")) +
    ggtitle("Range of Age Groups") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "italic"))

```



# Visualizing Data: scatter plot
Scatterplots are crated with the **geom_point()** geom. If you have an issue with overplotting points, you can add a small about of randomness to each point's position with **geom_jitter()**.

```{r scatterplot, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = duration, color = td_enroll)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("Duration of Last Call Against Age and Enrollment Outcome") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

```



# Try it!: scatter plot
Which of these code chunks would result in the plot below?

```{r scatterplot_ex, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = balance, color = td_enroll)) +
    geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("Avg Balance Against Age and Enrollment Outcome") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

```



# Try it!: scatter plot (MC)
```{r scatterplot_try, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
### Option A
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = balance, color = td_enroll)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("Avg Balance Against Age and Enrollment Outcome")

### Option B
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = balance, color = td_enroll)) +
    geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("Avg Balance Against Age and Enrollment Outcome") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

### Option C
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = balance, y = age, color = td_enroll)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("Avg Balance Against Age and Enrollment Outcome") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```



# Visualizing Data: pie chart
To build a pie chart, you'll want to use **polar coordinates**:

```{r pie_chart, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
banksmp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(1), fill = age_group)) +
    geom_bar(width = 1) +
    coord_polar(theta = "y") +
    ggtitle("Proportions of Age Group") +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank(), 
          axis.title.x = element_blank(), plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

```



# Introduction to caret
The convenience of the **caret** package is its ability to call many modeling/ML packages and their algorithms without having to manually load each one; as well as functions convenient for subsetting and pre-processing data. Take time to read the [caret documentation](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) for more information.

- **CreateDataPartition()**: create subsets of your data for training and testing a model
- **train()**: train a model fit. Contains a *method* argument for specifying the type of model, followed by any model parameters
- **predict()**: predict a model fit on new data
- **set.seed()**: helps with reproducible research by generating a sequence of pseudo random numbers for use in an algorithm which uses randomization (e.g. optimization)
- **confusionMatrix()**: create confusion matrix (tp, fp, tn, fn) to evaluate a classification algorithm

This package follows the *formula notation* common in R:
```{r caret_intro, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# the ~ represents that we are modeling for the IV based upon a list of DVs separted by +
DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV3 + ... + IVn

# if you'd like to model an IV based upon all DVs, put a . after the ~
DV ~ .

```



# Creating Train and Test Subsets
<br></br>
The **caret** package makes it easy to create subsets of your data for training and testing models. First, we can use the **createDataPartition()** function to return a list of indices for a training set, then use these indices to actually split our data.

```{r train_test, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# randomly sample 70% of data without replacement and return their index position
indxtrain <- createDataPartition(y = banksmp$td_enroll, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

# use the index positions to create a subset for training the models
banktrain <- banksmp[indxtrain,]

# back out those records in the training set to create a subset for testin the models
banktest <- banksmp[-indxtrain,]

# keep that environment clean!
rm(i, indxtrain)

```



# Building and Evaluating a Logistic Regression Model
<br></br>
Here we will build a logistic model with *td_enroll* as the dependent variable, and *age*, *duration*, *balance*, and *previous* as independent variables.

```{r logistic, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# fit a logistic regression model with DV = td_enroll and IVs = age, duration, balance, previous
logfit <- train(td_enroll ~ age + duration + balance + previous, 
                data = banktrain , method = "glm", family = "binomial")

# predict outcome in test data set using logfit
logclasses <- predict(logfit, newdata = banktest)

# view confusion matrix for prediction accuracy and other metrics
confusionMatrix(data = logclasses, reference = banktest$td_enroll, positive = "yes")

```

<br></br>
This model could definitely be improved upon with some analytical tender, love, and care. But now you have an idea of how to fit a model using the **caret** package.


# Building and Evaluating a Decision Tree Model
<br></br>
Using the same independent and dependent variables as in the previous example, let's build a CART decision tree:

```{r decisiontree, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# fit a CART decision tree with all IVs explaining the DV
dtfit <- train(td_enroll ~ ., data = banktrain, method = "rpart")

# predict outcome in test data set using dtfit
dtclasses <- predict(dtfit, newdata = banktest)

# view confusion matrix for prediction accuracy and other metrics
confusionMatrix(data = dtclasses, reference = banktest$td_enroll, positive = "yes")

# using the rpart.plot pacakge we can view the model structure
rpart.plot(dtfit$finalModel)

```

<br></br>
**Note** if you're using a parametric model, then the tuning parameters will be supplied to arguments after *method*.



# R Control Flow
Many R users find that they can get by perfectly with stepping through code chunks iteratively (similar to what we've been doing during these trainings). However, R would not be a *programming language* without a formal **control flow**, or constructs useful in building functions, programs, and packages. Examples of three common control flows constructs are shown below, see **?Control** for more information.

```{r control_flow, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# example of the for loop syntax.This will iterate through the elements of an obect, performing the operations inside the loop for each iteration
for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    # do something here
    
    # then do some more here
}

# example of a while loop.This will iterate through the elements of an object while the condition 
# still holds true. Make sure there eventually is a break from the loop, else you'll get caught in an infinite loop
while (condition) {
        # do something here
    
    # then do some more here
}

## example of if-elseif-else flow
if (condition1) {
    # do this
} else if (condition2) {
    # else do this
} else {
    # if the first two conditions aren't true, then do this!
}

```



# The *apply Function Family
<br></br>

An alternative to using for loops in R is available with the ***apply** family of functions. 

<br></br>
The family includes **apply()**, **lapply()**, **vapply()**, **sapply()**, and more! Amongst them all, the premise remains the same: apply a function to each element of an object. The differences lie in which object types are supplied to the function as well as the type of object(s) returned as a result.

```{r apply_family, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# apply the table() function to the second through fifth cols of banksmp and return results as a list
lapply(banksmp[c(2:5)], table)

```

For more information on this family of functions see [DataCamp's tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-tutorial-apply-family#gs.BLHZWbs).



# Writing Your Own Functions
<br></br>
Functions are another type of object in R. You can define your own functions for use in analysis using the **function(x)** command as such:

```{r functions, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
myfunc <- function(x) {
    # something here
    
    # something else here
}

```

In the example above, **x** represents an argument to the **myfunc** function. You can specify more arguments, and assign any argument a default value using **arg = [somthing here]**.



# Try it!: Defining a Function to Calculate Factorials

```{r factorial, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# here is one way to right a function to return the nth factorial
# it works, but could be improved for efficiency since it can only take one number
# and doesn't "learn" from previous calls (i.e. has to recompute each time)
factorial <- function(x) {
    if (x < 0) {
        stop("x should be greater than or equal to zero")
    } else if (!(x %% 1 == 0)) {
        stop("x should be an integer value")
    }
    
    sqce <- seq_len(x)
    tot <- 1
    
    if (x == 0) {
        return(tot)
        } else {

        for (i in sqce) {
            tot <- tot * i
        }
    }
    print(tot)
}

# what shold the factorial of 6 return?
factorial(6)
```

# Week in Review / Q&A
ALOT of information was covered this week. With what you've learned, you're now prepared to perform analysis in R from start to finish. Furthermore, by taking time to digest and review the materials presented, you can start to make connections amongst the concepts and continue developing your skillset.

- R Data Structures, Operators, Common *base* Functions
    - While it's important to understand R's data structures, you also saw this week that the **data frame** is the most common data structure you'll encounter during analysis
- Reading and Writing Data
- Reshaping and Manipulating Data, Parsing Strings
    - This is where the **tidyverse** really shows its advantages. If you ever want to undertake a challenging exercise, try to reproduce some of the results from day two using only *base* and *utils* functions
- Graphing and Building Models
- Programming in R with functions and control flow

**Thank you for attending, I hope you found it useful and educational. As you continue to explore R, I encourage you to share things you find helplful and/or interesting- don't forget that *open source* is all about collaboration and shared learning. Now...let's open it up for some questions!**
