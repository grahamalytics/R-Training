I have a specific container that I put my dog food in so it doesn't get any moisture. It's even air tight. This could be the best dog food out there, but if the quality control is bad, I won't be buying it. I'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food."

Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use).

I bought a 5-pack of this vegetable mix, and it's just disgusting. I am very passionate about Indian cooking, and cook Indian food at least 4 times a week (and am an Indian myself). Firstly, MTR seems to use the exact same sauce base for all the curries (I bought the Paneer Makhani and it has the same revolting flavor base), and the sauce is just not right! If you tell me that it has Indian flavors, I won't disagree with you. But Indian spices need to be used better - they must be matured properly by cooking them off in hot oil, adding aromatics in the right amounts, etc. And the vegetables were semi-raw, with no flavors inside the veggies .. all in all, it can be a poor man's emergency meal, but no way on earth does it even REMOTELY deserve the number of stars it has! Very very bad food indeed .. =("

It was $23 and now jumped to 27.90 for some reason. All brands were increased the same so it wasn't the manufacturer. You can still get them for $.53 a cup at coffeeforless.com. Amazon is no longer the cheapest.
B005K4Q1YA,AXQRKLHSGET5M,Vera Reynolds,1,1,1,2012-01-08,Bad Stuff,This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had in a k-cup. I buy a lot of k-cups this is the by far the worst. Don't waste your money on this product.

Most are brown or black and if you eat one of those it is the nastiest thing you will ever taste. They are also very inconsistent in size from opening a shell and finding nothing, to getting very small hard brown or black un eatable peanuts. Not Only are they inconsistant in size but taste to, and the good ones you do find aren't that good. Don't let the big bag full of large good looking peanuts fool you."
B009B87MX0,A5IF4A10HS3E9,"momof3 ""Shannon""",1,1,1,2010-03-19,Changed formulas?,We have four indoor dogs that ever since they were puppies we have fed them science diet. The main reason was because chicken was the first ingredient. Now I have notice since December our dogs have really started shedding. There fur also is not as soft as it used to be. I just thought maybe they were shedding their winter coat. Well I finally remembered to check the ingredients on the bag this week. Boy was I shocked when I read the first ingredient now. It is no longer chicken on my bag. It is ground whole grain corn. Now if I wanted to feed them that I would buy the much cheaper dog food. So check your bags for the ingredients. I will no longer be using Science Diet.
B0051ZCNIQ,A1JHURB5O69G8S,Thomas S. Lindner,3,3,1,2012-03-15,Package and shipping issue,"I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any ""I am sorry for your inconvenience"" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware."

He told me to take it out of the fridge and just dump out the entire bottle."

It said Ships from and sold by Amazon.com<br /><br />And I loved the soup, its amazing but every single can was dented. I dont think I'm ever going to buy any can foods from amazon ever again. Some of the dents were really bad and you can die if you eat some of the cans they send."
B0000V8HTU,A2F082NC38AZOK,Xiaodong,0,6,1,2011-03-04,perfect example for not buying coffee online - especially when you hope forbetter,"It is the second time I bought coffee from amazon only to find out those beans or grounds are ONLY 4 months away from ""best before"" date. Last time it was air-tight tins of LaVazza ground, so it is not so bad at least I can drink though not enjoy. But this time the staled beans with pathetic taste really disappointed me a lot!!! I can't even bear the espresso made with this beans. Next time think twice if you will order coffee online, especially those beans bags. Since I lived in New York City, I should have listened to my friend and buy those freshly roasted beans from less than a week ago at local espresso shops."

It was horrible compared to the real thing. I can't compare these to other brands of preserved chestnuts, but the flavor was strange and I was surprised to find the chestnuts dark brown and sticky. Then I found a chestnut covered in a green film of mold. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing these again."

I would like to purchase pre-packaged Baby Food, but after Stage 1 all I can seem to find are products with Vegetables and Fruit mixed so the food tastes sweet. I guess I have to stick with making my own baby food. Oh and the packaging is so convenient that you can even forego the Spoon and Dish, what does this teach your Children!"

B000YSTGGW,AGPCDJRRNAA11,Deepal S Patel,0,0,1,2012-01-14,Toxic Hexane used in extraction of DHA,"I bought both the rice and oatmeal 6 packs.  The cans clearly state they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek).  If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae.  Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane.  Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid.  I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead."

I opened the door, yelled for the driver to come back and pick up the box and handed it back to him with tea pouring out of the box.<br /><br />After contacting Amazon and explaining what happened I recommended they have the boxes marked fragile as they were glass.  After several weeks I came home to find a box on my porch marked with 2 fragile stickers.  I picked it up and heard the broken glass and tea once again pouring out of the box.  Opening the box I found 2 jars of the 6 shattered.  The box was over sized with the jars simply lying inside rolling around and it was easy to see how they break.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this product from Amazon unless you like destroyed product."

So if you're baby is crying and is constantly up, and constipated, then please go right to Similac Alimentum.  There's something that's different about this formula in the past few years that is bothering the babies. There is some change that is making babies sicks."

Ten days after the cereal was shipped, it's still listed as 'in transit' with FedEx SmartPost, and there's no customer service number to call about the shipment. I submitted an online query 5 days ago with SmartPost, and there's been no response. I've cancelled the subscription (obviously) and suspect that I'll never see the package or a refund. Too bad - it seems like the subscription service would have been a great deal for this excellent cereal."

The bitter aftertaste lasted all day and I had to lay down because of nausea. They were awful. I checked the expiration date on the package and they were still considered fresh until next year.  I have no idea what was wrong with them but you can bet I'll never try another package. Horrible awful stuff. Just horrid!

I purchased this specifically for a person with heart problems.  One of the problems with canned foods is too much sodium, so the No Salt Added is a good feature.  Another problem is cholesterol content.  The ad for this product states 0 mg cholesterol, which is a false statement.  Apparently the supplier did not update the ad when Health Valley changed their recipe for their No Salt Tomato soup and is now adding cholesterol.  The cans I received have a ""NEW"" on the label, which the can shown in the ad does not.  This is an honest mistake on the seller's part, but he should correct it, and he should list the true contents."

My daughter & I have gluten & dairy allergies, so I opted NOT to use cheese in this original mix, but to make it into rolls according the the directions on the cheese rolls box.  These were easy to make & texture was good--little crispy outside & chewy inside.  Rolls were VERY small (golf ball size or smaller) when made according to instructions.  Problem was the flavor.  It was VERY bland.  The cheese must give these the wonderful taste, because neither my dauther nor I care to even eat them & I will probably end up throwing them out.  Simply no flavor.

It had apparently been in this condition for a while as some of the creamer had thickened and adheared to the insides of the box in nasty clumps. At first, I thought perhaps I could check and save some of the little containers, but on second look, it was apparent I was wrong. What a nasty mess, and the worst part is even if I wanted to return this mess, I discovered it cannot be returned. So I'm appealing to you to consider refunding this horendous example of bad packaging.

I was on vacation last week and forgot to bring my jar of ApiHealth Active Manuka Honey with me. So I went onto Amazon from my iPhone and found one that I could have shipped quickly on my Amazon Prime account - which was the ""Manuka Health New Zealand Active MGO 550+"".  The price at $55 is the going rate (albeit expensive) so I didn't give that a thought when I ordered it....but...what I didn't notice is that it's only 250 grams and the high quality active Manuka honey for which the going rate is $55 is for 500 grams!!!  So, for a product that is already too expensive, they're selling HALF THE SIZE for the same price, making it OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE.  In addition, when I got home, I checked on the AMHA (Active Manuka Honey Assoc) web site and Manuka Health New Zealand is not a licensee. Nor do they use the UMF standard, therefore, there is no way to verify the quality or the true Activity Level of the Manuka Honey in the jar.<br /><br />It tastes fine but it does not have the delicious taste of ApiHealth or Watson and Son or Spirits Bay, all of which are excellent.  This one is obviously Manuka, but there is also a bit of the taste of regular honey, which is an entirely different flavor.<br /><br />If this jar were the standard size of 500g, at this pricing level, it would have cost $110!!!! Don't get me wrong, they didn't lie - the site specifically says 250g - but without the other jar in front of me, that size didn't mean anything to me and given that the price is the same as what others charge for twice as much, it never occurred to me when I ordered it that this was such a rip off."

I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils.

B000084DWM,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,3,3,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."

I was very disappointed for 2 reasons:<br />1) The photo in the variety shows 3 of each kind of flavor/brand but my package has 7 of one, 5 of another and one or two of the other flavors. not a good ""variety""<br />2) The package i received had 7 that were EXPIRED, but not just expired, 3 months out of date! That's 7 out of a 30 pack, almost a 1/3 of the package.<br />I think the company needs to re-think their idea of customer service as this seems to be an ongoing issue. I am not the first customer this has happened to and i dont think ill be the last.<br />I will be calling the company tomorrow demanding a replacement for the expired ones but to send different flavors for the missing variety ones.<br />WARNING to all future customers...

After that, they were fine and healthy on it with shiny coats.<br /><br />HOWEVER, upon receiving my third Diamond Naturals Chicken & Rice, they developed awful diarrhea and stomach problems (April 15ish). A couple days later, I found out the Lamb & Rice formula was recalled, but I suspected something was wrong with the Chicken & Rice. Amazon refunded me, and I insisted they should talk to Diamond Naturals and put a warning on their site. I called Diamond Naturals and they said our dogs probably received a bad batch unrelated to the Lamb & Rice and they would be happy to pay for our next bag. We didn't want to risk it and decided to make our own food.<br /><br />Now the cat is out of the bag, and Diamond is recalling ALL SKU's (as of May 4, 2012, today), including several other brands they distribute. Humans have become infected with salmonella from handling the dog food. This is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. I am hoping that after this event, there will be more regulations for dog food so that we know our pets can have healthy, affordable food. For now I'm not trusting any dog food brand (that I can afford) and will have my dogs on a raw diet.<br /><br />SOURCES:<br /><br />[...]"

We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."

I love all things candy and chocolate but even this made my teeth hurt.

Yuck!","Having tried several of Krusteaz's products in the past and not being impressed, we decided to give them another try, this time their Gingerbread Cake and Cookie Mix.  Christmas was upon us, and gingerbread sounded good.  We purchased it at ALDI (a special buy) in December.  The expiration date was April 2013, so there's no question it was fresh.  I tried the gingerbread cake recipe on the side of the box.  Following the directions exactly, I mixed the ingredients and baked the cake at the recommended temperature until a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed was the smell.  Gingerbread typically has a strong odor, but this was beyond strong.  It had an overbearing ""perfumy"" chemical odor that burned your nostrils.  After it cooled we served it with a little whipped cream.  We each tentatively took a bite and pushed it aside.  My throat burned for several minutes, and I could still taste it the next morning.  Needless to say we threw the rest of it out.<br /><br />This is not the first Krusteaz product we've wasted eggs, other ingredients, time, and money on.  We've tried their blueberry bread/muffin mix (extremely heavy), raspberry bars (heavy, perfumy), lemon bars (a soggy mess), some kind of orange bars (tough and dry), and chocolate chunk cookies (fell flat).  Without exception every Krusteaz product we've tried has been inedible.  The thing is our current oven is the best we've ever owned.  It bakes evenly and turns out beautiful cakes -- that is, when the cake mix or recipe is good.  Even our incredible oven can't help Krusteaz mixes.<br /><br />I contacted the company and was told that the remaining box of lemon bars I have is out of date.  There's no date on it, but I don't doubt that it's out of date since it's been in the pantry for a couple of years.  We had bought two boxes at the same time and tried one immediately only to have to throw out the whole pan.  I was just cleaning out the pantry and decided to call the company after the latest failure to deliver by one of their over-priced products (the gingerbread).  All they could offer was a coupon for a replacement Krusteaz product.  Thanks but no thanks.  The lady said, ""It sounds like you just don't like our products.""  Having tried several of your products I have to concur.  Because all of your products that we've tried are awful!  Judging by their prices their products should be the ""Cadillac"" of baking mixes, but they're anything but.  The stores here carry only a limited variety of Krusteaz products, and I think we've tried just about everything locally available and couldn't eat any of it.  We'll be sticking with Betty, Duncan, and Pillsbury from now on."

The second time I found another hair down further in the bag (oddly enough a different color and longer) it completely repulsed me.<br /><br />This isn't bad tea, but I would say there's a quality control problem in filling the bags.

I told her I called in Dec and she said ""someone else likely helped you"". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's ""acceptable"" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product."

I will drink a cup of gas station coffee as long as it doesn't taste like dirty dish water. I bought this product knowing that Eight O'Clock is not a high-end, artisan coffee. However, I was hoping that once ground, it would be somewhat palatable despite it's low price. Unfortunately, that was not the case. This coffee has no flavor, just a plastic, stale aftertaste. I'm not sure if there is an issue with quality control at Eight O'Clock, or if the beans are just extremely low quality. Either way, I would suggest spending your money on something else; there are other inexpensive brands that don't taste like a grocery bag in liquid form."

B001OCG0O8,A32BB93M3NU59K,"Sarah Thompson ""Particular about products!""",0,2,1,2011-07-21,Hate This! Overly Sweet with a Bitter Artificial After-Taste! Nothing Like their Other Lemonades!,"Despite still not being convinced of the safety of any artificial sweeteners and finding the price somewhat inexplicably high, I've been a years-long devotee of the various Crystal Light Lemonades due to the low cal factor and the fact that I don't like carbonated beverages.<br /><br />I love the Pink Lemonade flavor, though it seemed to disappear for a while and still is scarce. I also like the regular and Raspberry Lemonades, though the Raspberry seems to have changed formula for the worse over the past year or so. I do doctor these two flavors by either mixing them in equal parts and/or adding a splash of tangerine juice or some berry juice to the plain lemonade or a fresh-squeezed lemon (bottled lemon juice in a pinch) to either to perk them up and made them less fake tasting.<br /><br />So, looking for some additional variety, and going by the unanimous high praise in the reviews, I thought I'd give the Pomegranate flavor a try. Wow--bad decision! First off, I don't know where the Lemonade part comes in, as I don't taste a bit of it. I even tried my trick of mixing it 1 to 1 with the plain Lemonade mix, but to no avail. The phony ""pomegranate"" flavors, along with enough pigment to dye a blanket scarlet, and a distinct bitter artificial sweetener after-taste refuse to be concealed.<br /><br />I even thought I'd salvage my financial output by using these over time by adding just a but to my other Crystal Light concoctions, but this stuff, even in the tiniest measure, overpowers the everything. And, since each unit comes in a 5000 year thick plastic container, I can't even just toss them, but must add them to my giant pile of them filling up my garage, as I'm sure I can eventually find a use for them. (They're great for small items--if you're a crafter or a carpenter you'd probably be happy to use them to store beads, nails, screws, etc., but even you will end up with a huge stockpile unless you don't mind clogging the landfills.)<br /><br />I also don't care for the new packets Crystal Light is using inside the plastic tubs, but I've already complained about that in one or two other reviews or comments..."

It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid.

I give her organic dry food most of the time, but after talking to some other cat owners, they informed me that I should be mixing some wet food into her diet because wild cats get most of their moisture from their food in nature and don't drink a lot of water. I thought it couldn't hurt to give this to the cat as a treat a couple times a week, but she won't even touch it. I tried mixing her regular dry food into it to give it some texture, and she just ate the dry food around it.

Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress.

However, there is a price to pay once you screw off the cap and pour.<br /><br />It seems that Kirkland may not have engineered the twist off caps to correct diameter specifications for the plastic containers they twist onto.<br /><br />Warning when twisting off these Kirkland caps, they might pull the plastic top off that's meant to filter the seasoning through holes which give a controlled sprinkling effect.  Instead, on numerous occassions, I've had the unpleasant experience of taking off the cap and pouring, then realizing too late that my dish is covered in mounds of Kirkland's signature seasoning.  The phantom plastic I found stuck to the inner top of the cap, laughing at me.<br /><br />The first time I thought, silly me, I've put too much pressure on the cap when twisting and look at this mess.  I felt I could laugh along with the phantom plastic. The fourth time, when it happened with the salt instead of the pepper I cursed Kirkland and felt the phantom cap was definitely laughing at me, not with me.  The good news is that regardless of the amount you overpour, you'll still have plenty of seasoning left to make the mistake a few times more. Don't do what I did and say you'll be more careful next time, it ain't you its the laughing cap.<br /><br />So I recommend if you've already purchased this product that you transfer the seasoning into a more trustworthy container that'll pour out without causing you to be laughed at and begin cursing Kirkland.  Hopefully it won't take you more than two occurrences to remedy the defect.  If by chance a Kirkland representative reads this review, please pass this discovery on so that just maybe your Research & Development folks will come up with something more..........user friendly!  That is if the R&D department isn't too busy trying to catch their breath after laughing at us consumers.<br /><br />(Great Seasoning Plus Bad Packaging Equals Inedible Dishes)<br /><br />Thanks for letting me vent Amazon."

There is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak.  So far the only K-cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast (I think that's the brand), but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save, so I always had coffee.<br /><br />I ordered the Tully's Italian Roast to see how it is, but it too isn't as good as the other."

I am a big fan of this line's other treats. They usually have very few ingredients and so I ordered these for our pup thinking they would be fine. BIG mistake!! When the package arrived I read the ingredients list and it has sorbitol in it...which is a sugar alcohol. This gives humans diarrhea very often but I tried giving her one just to see anyways. Huge huge huge mistake. She had diarrhea for 2 days straight every 20-40 minutes. I would not recommend these to any dog owner.

The Melitta packing states that these will fit all single serve brewing machines. This is not true! They are thicker than the Senseo pods and when using them the Senseo lid pops open and hot water spills out. After contacting Melitta they send me an email saying I would have to buy soft pods. These are soft pods!?!? I'm very dissapointed! The coffee tastes great if you are lucky enough to fill a cup without spilling all water.

Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point?

I expected that, and discarded them.  Many had holes in them.  I wasn't pleased about that.  I searched through the package, and found perfect ones, placed them in a pan of water, and watched two inch long cracks appear in them.  ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!  I threw away the first 7-8 that formed these giant cracks in the water - and eventually just gave up and put two wrappers in the water at a time (rotating one by 90 degrees - so the cracks were in different directions).<br /><br />Please understand - they are not splitting because I was rough with them; or because I used something sharp to pick them up; or because I overstuffed them... they are splitting in the warm water.  The wrapper appears fine when it goes in, and as it softens, multiple large cracks (1/2"" to over 2"" long) split the wrapper.  Maybe the machine that pressed the pattern into them wasn't calibrated properly?  Don't know...<br /><br />Sure - you can use them... but you have to use two at a time.  It is like making a sandwich and having to use 4 pieces of bread to hold it together.  Ridiculous!"

MADE IN CHINA,"I had been buying my 2 year old Bichon Frise these Happy Hips Duck Treats for  months until recently when I purchased a large bag that, upon opening it, reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach. The smell was overwhleming and disgusting. Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, ""Made in China"".<br /><br />Up until this time I had assumed their treats were made in the USA, and some of them are. But after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from China.<br /><br />Do NOT trust this product!!!"

However, a few years ago I moved to Hawaii, and had to order this tea from Amazon.com<br /><br />I bought 6 boxes of 50 bags of the Ahmad English Afternoon Tea and upon opening the boxes the first thing I noticed was a VERY strong smell of bergamot. Upon brewing the tea,<br />the taste and smell of bergamot was overwhelming. I think the bergamot is even stronger than Earl Gray tea. So I am sadly disappointed that this Ahmad English Afternoon Tea was<br />very different from the one I had been buying for years.<br /><br />Maybe the blend was recently changed? Could it be a quality control issue? I emailed Ahmad Tea and got NO response about this matter so I am posting this after a fair attempt to get an explanation.<br /><br />Buyer beware, Ahmad Tea may be selling ""rejects"" on their online store."

Very soon I was tweaking quite extremely and my friend noticed how irritable I had become from the drink.  However, it did seem to wear off a few hours later without a crash.  I gave it a tentative try the next day, only drinking a tiny sip twice during the day.  Similar effect, so far so good.

He's had bad cradle cap and eczema on his face since he was about two months old. After trying MANY other formulas (Enfamil, Good Start Gentle Plus, Good Start Soy, Similac Advance, Baby's Only Soy), the doctor finally suggested going hypoallergenic. So we tried Nutramigen... he seemed okay for the first couple of minutes, then he pulled the bottle out of his mouth and gagged. I tried again... and again, he drank for a minute or two, then gagged again. Then he refused to drink any more. After reading up on hypo formulas I was expecting a bad smell, but I didn't think it'd be bad enough to make my son want to hurl!<br /><br />My son never had any problems drinking all of the other formulas; this is the only one that actually made him gag. Maybe if I had started it earlier when his tastebuds were more immature, I would've had more success. I'm hesitant to give him the Alimentum because of the high sugar content. I guess my son will just have to continue suffering with rashes until I can find a formula that works for him. :("

That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is ""animal fat."" It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime."

I took my dog to two different vets, both of whom said the change in his food was almost certainly the cause of the illness.  When I took a closer look at the remaining Sojos food I found that it contained bits of wood, twine and bulap sack material.  When I changed my dog back to his old food, the allergy went away.  Sojos refused to admit that their food was the cause of my dog's illness, and refused to refund even the money I had paid them for the food, let alone reimburse me for over the over $700 I spent for veterinary care.  Don't risk your dog's health with Sojos.  If you want to make home-cooked food, ask your vet for a recipe."

The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time.

First off, Amazon's price is absolutely ridiculous. You should be able to get a 24 pack of this stuff for around $33 (at Sam's, etc.). Secondly, this stuff tastes gross (we had the berry flavored...more like vomit berry favor). Thirdly and MOST importantly: it didn't do anything except make us actually more tired. We couldn't stop yawning about 20 minutes after shooting our drinks down. I've read the negative reviews that other people have written...believe them and save your money! The positive reviews I am convinced are by people who are affected by the placebo effect. They think they should be more awake, so they ""feel"" more energized..."

I may have received a ""bad batch"" (or maybe the bag had been on the shelf much too long) because the beans don't even smell like coffee - the aroma was something like a mildly unpleasant chemical odor and nothing more.  I ground up the beans thinking that might release some of the oil that makes coffee flavorful, but that didn't change anything.  The finished brew was, not surprisingly, terrible as well; the chemical aroma had dissipated, leaving no flavor at all.  To top it off, the half cup I drank left me with terrible shakiness and heart palpitations from the caffeine, which obviously they didn't remove enough of.  I would tolerate this stuff until it was finished if it was drinkable, but unfortunately, the two bags I bought are going immediately into the trash.  I would strongly recommend looking for another brand."

Canidae switched their formula (and mfg) and I immediately switched to another food afer the reported of problems.  My feed store talked me into trying their 'new' formula, and I went back to ALS - BIG mistake.  I have experienced 15-20+% weight loss, explosive diarreha, vomitting, lethargy. etc.  I have 5 dogs - 60-100+ lbs, varying pedigrees, ages 1 to 12+ - all sick (15-20% weight loss, poor coats, vomitting, etc.).  I have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs - bottomline - blood panels were OK, food (Canidae) was the issue.  What use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed.  An entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula.  I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.  If you love Las Vegas and Russian Roulette feed Canidae - if want to avoid major Vet expenses and heartache choose another food.  Do your homework - research the Canidae ALS problems - then make the best 'educated' decision for you and your pets.<br />----<br />It's been a over a year since I originally posted review of this product, and I thought it was time for an update.<br /><br />I still warn folks from feeding Canidae ALS...other Canidae formuals I don't know.  My dogs have recovered (thank goodness).  They are back to running the fenceline, greeting visitors, etc. - and not as sickly as they had become - aka the lethergic, diarreha, lost weight crew I was faced with.<br /><br />I know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning Canidae - and I use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for Canidae....until the formula change and the Vet expenses I was forced to face.  Believe me - with a very heavy heart I cannot recommend Canidae any more.  I do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the Internet, any vindications against the company, or any personnal gain...just a great concern for the illnesses I've experienced with my 'pack' (5+ dogs).  It took several months (under Vet care & dry dog food changes) for my dogs to recover, and I don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what I've/we've gone through.  Please, please, PLEASE check out [...] (a highly recommended (non-bias)dog food analysis site).  They are still recommending Canidae ALS as a 5-Star (6 star being the highest rating) premium food to feed - with the caveate 'However, from a position of being a product about which DFA heard very few complaints, the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially.'<br /><br />All I ask is do your own personal research concerning this food, keep an eye on your pet's food reactions, and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed/furry' family members."

As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company.

Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low-carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits."

The count is not listed on the front of the package; you have to read the fine print of the nutrition information label to find that a serving is 1 biscotti and there are only 8 servings in the package.

I don't know if its the brittle plastic packaging that Diamond uses or if the nuts are old to begin with but unfortunately I now have to pay almost double at the grocery store. I did use the nuts for baking and the slightly stale taste is definitely masked when you grind them up and put them in chocolate chip cookies or something similar but if you plan on eating these raw like I was doing on a regular basis then prepare yourself to be biting into quite a few stale ones and a few downright rancid ones in every bag.<br /><br />I also just want to mention that I also order the Planters pecan halves and they are delicious with never a stale nut in the package and Amazon has them at a great price too!!"

Speak with your dollars; don't give into the temptation; and spend your money on something else.<br /><br />It's for that reason that I have no idea how these Candy Corn Oreos taste. As much as I'd like to try them, no Oreo is worth $15 a box."

B009B87SAC,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,18,24,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

We tried all the tricks to get it to work, reset the transmitter and receiver, fresh batteries, moved the meat probe, etc.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />It has been more than 90 days since I ordered this product, so I called the Brookstone Limited Warranty Service at the 800 number listed in the manual.  A very nice but obviously frustrated gal tried for 25 minutes to find my order in the system but couldn't pull it off.  I asked her if she could just add me to the system since I obviously had a Brookstone product and a receipt from Amazon.  She said no, it doesn't work that way.  After speaking to her supervisor I was told I needed to contact Amazon for support.  Amazon said I had to contact the seller, TLC Stores.  I sent a email to TLC stores, well see what they say.<br /><br />As of this posting I have spent $65.98 for a product that doesn't work and over an hour and counting trying to get warranty service.<br /><br />For now I would say STAY AWAY FROM BROOKSTONE PRODUCTS!  My, albeit limited, experience has not been a positive one.<br /><br />If the situation is resolved I will update this posting and let everyone know the results of my quest for even marginally adequate customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/27/11<br /><br />Brookstone will not warranty this item because I purchased it from TLC Store (amazon seller).  Brookstone only warranties their items to the ""original purchaser"".  Brookstone told me that by purchase this item from TLC Store ""you effective bought this item at a garage sale from the original purchaser so the warranty is null and void.""  I purchased this item thinking it was ""new"" with a warranty to back it up.  TLC Store has a 30 day warranty, or so I am told.  This effective took the 1 yr manufacture warranty and turned it into a 30 day warranty from some gal selling stuff from her garage.  I sent repeated emails but only received two replies neither of them came close to resolving the issue.<br /><br />Bottom line, this item is junk.  TLC Store has done nothing to help rectify the problem.<br /><br />2 LESSONS LEARNED<br />  1.  THIS BROOKSTONE PRODUCT IS JUNK AND THEY ARE UNWILLING TO BACKUP THEIR PRODUCTS.<br /><br />  2.

The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.

B002PO80X8,AB0TLNLNOAGY4,"Shanshad ""shanachie_shadowfax""",3,4,1,2009-10-23,What were they thinking?,"My son has been enjoying Beechnut fruits and veggies since 6 months old, and I've been perfectly happy with them.  I got some of the other combinations on a whim when he was ten months old to try out.  One of them was this Country Breakfast mix.<br /><br />My son, normally not a picky eater, took one bite and refused adamantly to eat more.  At first we took his behavior for simple stubbornness and tried every trick we knew to get him to eat, but as the hour ticked on and neither his father nor I could make headway, we both tried the food ourselves.<br /><br />After that we threw out the jar and opened up some peach puree as an apology to my son.  The country breakfast tastes terrible.  I don't mean it tastes just odd or bland. It tastes like dirty dishwater that has sat for several days.  I can't believe we were trying to feed our son that!  So, we'll not be getting anymore of that particular mix--though I'm happy enough with Beechnut product for their standard fruit and veggie mixes.<br /><br />Please be aware that you probably don't want to order this in bulk unless you're sure your child already likes it and will eat it.

This coffee never smells good no matter if it's still in bean form, being ground, being brewed, being drank, whatever. Very poor taste. I've always been a Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, or Papa Nicholas drinker and this brand doesn't come close as far as flavor. It is light on the damaged stomach/esophagus though.

B0000DGFA9,A2HZLVB3Q7HBRE,Bri.,9,9,1,2010-07-30,Thrips Infestation!,"My bonsai seemed fine for about a week, and then it started dropping leaves, just like all the others'. Unlike everyone else who's posted here, I found out why. I watered and inspected the tree and found little (.5mm) silver mites running around in the soil-- lots of them.<br />I did a lot of research and then eventually took it to a local nursery where they said and my bonsai came with a nice little infestation of thrips palmi.<br />Thrips are a common glasshouse and factory nursery infestation that attack the roots of young plants. To an adult plant, thrips themselves do minimal damage even in large numbers but can stunt or warp growth by feeding on terminal shoots, the undersides of leaves, causing them to drop. Each of my dropped jade leaves had a small brown spot at the base where thrips had been feeding. The real danger from thrips is that they carry Watermelon silver mottle virus that makes your leaves turn silver and shrivel up.<br /><br />The reason the leaves start dropping is that thrips love the warm dry air of a house or apartment and the parasite population explodes when you house the plant indoors as advertised.<br /><br />Anyway, in summary, they mention they are the biggest US distributor of bonsai, and I believe them, 'cause my bonsai has the parasites to prove it!

I would like to add this update to the review below. Interestingly I just called another supplier of died organic fruit sold here on Amazon.com concerning some quality issues for their product and I was told that the problem was that their product was improperly stored at the Amazon.com warehouse. That might explain the mediocre quality of the raisins themselves as I mentioned in my receiver below. Nonetheless. it also appears that the pricing issue for this product still has not been rectified. My original review is below.<br /><br />My one star rating is more of a reflection on the pricing errors and description of this product than the taste or quality of the raisins (they are nothing special though and I would give them 2 or 3 stars out of 5 for taste and quality). As of 11/10/2011 the product description states ""California Gourmet, Inc. Organic Raisins (1.5-Ounce), 6-Count Single Serve Packages (Pack of 6)"" and that the $13.30 and that the unit price is $0.25 per ounce which therefore indicates a total of 54 ounces (36 1.5 oz. boxes) but in actuality you will only receive 9 ounces (6 1.5 oz. boxes) at a price of $1.48 per ounce and one of the highest prices per ounce for organic raisins here on Amazon.com (there are plenty of others brands available for around $0.35 per ounce but mostly in larger packages although Sun Maid 1.5 oz boxes are currently $0.26 per oz. if you ""subscribe and save"" Please see this link <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UKJS5E"">Sun Maid California Organic Raisins,  1.5-Ounce box  (Pack of 36)</a>). Anyway, I have brought this error to Amazon.com's attention and they indicated they would fix the errors but I thought in would be prudent to write this review in the interim in hopes of preventing anyone else from placing an order based on the unit price or product description thinking that they will receive 36 boxes (would be the best deal here) rather than 6 (one of the worst deals)."

I understand that coffee prices are soaring but I really wish Tim Hortons was up front about what is happening - not sneaking in a can that contains less product in order to keep the price the same.

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet."

I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference!

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.

They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required.

My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Water sufficient for processing, liver, wheat gluten, and meat by-products. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet.

However, this is my least favorite of their products.  This stuff is easy to cook with, it's true, but it tastes like rubber, smells bad when it's cooking, and has no flavor until you add your own spices.  I have no idea why I used to cook with this stuff so often other than that I didn't know much about cooking in HS and it looked ""high protein"" on the label.  I recently read The Whole Soy Story by Kaayla Daniel (Amazon has it), and was amazed to learn that processed soy products like TSP are processed at high temperatures, denaturing the proteins and leaving in loads with antinutrients that damage the thyroid among many other health problems they cause.  Although TSP appears to be almost all protein (like meat or tofu), in reality, you don't absorb much of the protein, anyway.  While I am glad Bob's is using organic soybeans to make their TSP (thereby leaving out the pesticides and genetically engineered ingredients), the fact that it's ""organic"" doesn't make it a healthy or even a safe product.  The dangerous antinutrients in soy are not a chemical additive or pesticide, they are in intrinsic part of the beans themselves, the plant's natural way of deterring pests.  Traditional foods made from soy and eaten over the past 400+ years were slow cooked and fermented, destroying the antinutrients and leaving the protein, vitamins, and minerals intact.  TSP is the total opposite of whole, healthy, fermented soy products like tempeh or miso soup, as it is not fermented and leaves in all the antinutrients.  As a longtime vegan on a gluten-free diet because of food allergies, I'll continue to buy other Bob's products (they have an amazing gluten-free line), but I am saddened they are still making highly-processed, extremely unhealthy items like TSP."

In fact I venture to guess that's how its made with the bubbles that are there by some process of heat related fermentation.<br /><br />My experience in 1976 after ordering was regretting the 4 bucks just spent getting it, but I defend myself by saying I was so thirsty and hoping for a cold drink. Ha ha. I was later to realize that o get that kind of experience you had a better shot by freezing bottles of water in the US, putting in dry ice and hoping for a positive customs experience. That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.<br /><br />Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.<br /><br />But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make. So if he'll drink it up, or I can pawn it off on some unaware visitor then I've got a nice bottle to use making bath oils. Great for lavendar scented bath potions.<br /><br />If you love it, give up on me in this regard. This is not a Sam-I -Am-Moment for the two of us. I would not, could not on one foot, in a bar, by a car, I will not, should not in cathedral, for a beagle or by that icosahedral.

Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.

Walker ""BookLoverAzleTexas""",0,2,1,2011-10-06,what a strange idea,"Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it."

B000GTJQN2,A1PDC47DE9WAV1,Ms. P.,15,15,1,2010-04-11,Didn't like the taste; High protein/grain free = issues,"My family recently adopted a 15 lb. Chihuahua mix who was found abandoned... we didn't know what she had eaten beforehand, but I'm guessing it wasn't anything high-quality due to the condition of her teeth and coat.  My goal was to get her on a high-quality diet (a ""6/6"" rating), and researched high protein/grain free diets and the benefits of them.  Additionally, I read up on Innova/Evo and understood that their products are extremely high quality, and someone else on a forum recommended we try the Red Meat Small Bite kibble with her.<br /><br />Even at first sniff, my dog indicated she didn't like it.  Of course, I figure it would take some time, so I worked on transitioning her off of the other kibble she was on.  It basically came down to the fact that she would only eat the Innova Evo when it was mixed in with some wet food, and oftentimes only with a bit of cottage cheese mixed in.<br /><br />Shortly after being on this high-protein diet (we didn't even finish her small bag of food), she began to urinate around the house, which she hasn't done in the 5 months we've had her.  It turns out she had urinary crystals, which the vet attributed to the high protein levels of her diet.  We had to put her on Flagil, and the vet recommended I put her on Hill's Science Diet c/d (which I know is full of corn and grain fillers).  After politely declining, I changed her diet to something more holistic that DOES have grain (a ""4/6"" rating).  She's fine now...<br /><br />Innova/Evo is an extremely high quality brand... perhaps it's better for larger and very active dogs.  I know not ALL dogs may have this reaction to a high-protein diet, but I really think people need to understand that high-protein/no grain isn't always the smartest choice in terms of your dog's health.  In our case, it turned out to be much more costly for us and more stressful for our dog to make this switch."

B003M5TG28,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,19,21,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

I've eaten many other gluten-free products (and occasionally some gluten ones) and have never run across this effect with any other flour blend. Before I figured out this bread was the culprit, I thought I had a stomach virus.<br /><br />In skimming reviews here and elsewhere, I've found a good number of people have had the same issue. I wrote to the company and they said that some people have trouble with sorghum and millet flours. The sorghum flour is the first ingredient, so that may be the case. I do think this bread dough is more glue-like than gluten products, so that may be part of the trouble. The Baking & Pancake Mix and the Brownie Mix seem to be fine for me, they have different ingredients. You can also make a loaf from the Baking & Pancake Mix, there is a recipe on the Pamela's web site - it's just not as nice as the Bread Mix loaf.<br /><br />Very disappointing."

I continued to use the ready to use cans thinking that it was the best for them, since the powder formula ""is not sterile.""  My babies have had problems with gas, indigestion, reflux, spitting/vomitting all the time they were on this formula.  I just thought it was what all babies go through and didn't want to switch to a different formula again.  I recently switched over to the powder formula, and they seem so much better.  It's like I turned off a switch....amazing.  I can't say that I'm 100% sure it's the metal cans, but my instinct tells me that the BPA they used to line the cans made them sick.<br /><br />There's a growing concern over the BPA used in infant formula cans (and other canned foods).  BPA is used to line the cans in order to ""preserve"" the formula...and giving it a longer shelf life.  BPA is commonly found in plastic containers/bottles, and there's a movement to remove BPA from baby bottles because of its adverse effects on infants.  If babies ingest BPA, it can cause developmental problems in the brain and reproductive system.  The latest studies show that the level of BPA in metal formula cans is so much higher than what is found in baby bottles.  There's more information online (check out the Environmental Working Group) about this issue, and as a concerned mother, I felt that I needed to let other mothers out there know about this.  I know that there are millions of mothers who know little or nothing about this issue.<br /><br />I get sick thinking about this.  At the very least, we have a responsibility to be informed when it concerns our babies."

However, around 2 months after using it, i discovered i was always itching my outer thigh and the area directly behind my armpits (i was using the new dove deodorant also) was getting very dry (something very uncommon for me because my skin rarely dries out). After changing my body wash and deodorant (about 3 weeks later) my symptoms are beginning to leave. This product is very harmful to your skin and it doesn't manifest its negative consequences until it's too late. The dry skin is almost impossible to get rid of and even now (almost 2 months after i stopped using this product), my itchy skin is still evident. I went to my dermatologist and he said that the irritation was caused by the chemicals in this body wash and it could take a long time for the irritation to recede because of how long i was using the product. I would never recommend the men's product line to anyone (but ""regular"" dove products have always been a favourite of mine). Stick with the brands that have been around for a long time - Axe, old spice, etc"

I have to say that I was very disappointed with this product. It does not disolve well at all and leaves chunks of formula in the bottle regardless how well you mix it and whether you use warm or cold water to dilute it with. The baby does not seem to like it any more or less, so we will be going back to Enfamil Infant Premium, which has all the same vitamns and completely disolves within seconds.<br />After mentioning about the chunks to a friend, I was told that it is a common problem with this brand of formula."

I'm taking the rest back and will never purchase this brand again. What a shame, their website really got me to believe it was tasty, healthy food. After doing some research, found there are mentions on the web about 2 recalls recently involving Natural Balance and many others with similar complaints about cats not liking the taste.<br /><br />One review I read elsewhere summed it up perfectly, ""Even if this food is actually healthy, what's the point in serving it if my cat won't eat it?""."

The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad).

I would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can, otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family doesn't like this unusual flavor."

After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies ""best if eaten by date"" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great."

B000BYM4WM,A30WYAYMNV6949,Loralyn Cramer,62,62,1,2011-12-16,Poisoned Product,"Two or three months ago, I subscribed to this company for automatic delivery of their dried chicken ""breasts"" each month.  When this month's order arrived, I allowed my Golden Retriever to eat one only.  Within a short time he became severely ill and continued vomiting repeatedly throughout the entire night.  I am a retired attorney/judge.  I do not become hysterical over every complaint that makes a claim that some product or other can kill your pet.  Now, I greatly regret my cavalier attitude about this particular item.  Had my Golden been weakened in any other way, I do not believe he would have survived this incident.<br />  My on-going purchase of this product despite prior bad press and numerous complaints was foolish.  But I trusted that the distributors of the dried chicken ""breasts"" would monitor this product more closely after the first recall of this product so that no other animals would be harmed.  Such was clearly not the case.  In fact, it appears that the only action the U.S. distributors took after the last recall was to print on each package that the product had come from the United States.  Closer inspection however reveals that although this product was packaged in the U.S., it continued to be imported from China.<br />  Amazon is by far the best retailer on the Internet by far.  My complaint is not against Amazon.  But I feel compelled to alert other potential customers regarding the poisoning my dog suffered (and he did suffer).  I can imagine other pets who are smaller, older, or in some other way more vulnerable than my Golden, would and could actually die if they consumed even the smallest amount of this product.  It's true that this was not the case every month.  Rather it is an intermittent but on-going problem.<br />  I cannot emphasize enough how serious this problem is.  It is absolutely necessary to eliminate the distribution of this product in the U.S. once and for all.  Please Amazon, end your involvement in this matter."

It seems to be creamier than the packet versions (no lumps of powder) but it is definitely sweet - and as much as I like sweet this was just too much.

When I started at Starbucks we tried Maxwell House canned coffee and compared it to Starbucks coffee that had been opened and ground for a few weeks and they tasted the same.

Both times, I have been disappointed. As a French Roast aficionado, I know what French Roast coffee should look and smell like. True French Roast coffee bean and grounds should be almost black in color with a pungent, almost burnt, aroma. These characteristic are imparted from the ""over roasting"" process which brings out the distinguishing flavor and aroma of the coffee beans. Furthermore, during the roasting process, the French Roast beans lose more moisture than normally roasted coffee beans. Therefore, the French Roast grounds have lower density and weighs less than normally roasted beans for an equivalent volume. The Maxwell House French roast has none of the traditional French Roast characteristics. The grounds color is much lighter than that of true French Roast, the aroma is not like true French Roast grounds, and the flavor is just like regular roast coffee. In addition, the grounds have the same density as regular Roast Coffee grounds. I am very disappointed with Maxwell House brand French Roast. Someone in the Coffee Division should learn how to properly roast the French Roast coffee."

Rachel, you are no Martha Stewart.<br /><br />Nutrish is anything but, it's loaded with COMMON dog food allergens (soy & corn), fillers (corn gluten & dried beet pulp) and<br />'animal fat'... which is a nice way of saying: We took all the dead & diseased animals from the slaughterhouse leftovers, plus the euthanized dogs & cats, rendered them down, drained off the fat & sold it back to the makers of Nutrish as 'animal fat'.<br /><br />There was a big investigation by the Dept. of Agriculture about 15 years ago, that discovered that many dog foods that<br />contained ANIMAL FAT had high amounts of barbiturates in them, because the fat contained the rendered remains of<br />euthanized pets, which are euthanized by a barbiturate overdose.  DVMs across the US were finding that it was taking<br />more of the barbiturate to euthanize the pet because the pet was being fed a small dose in its food on a daily basis,<br />due to the rendered animal fat found in about 25 dog foods, including Nutro.<br /><br />Dried Beet Pulp is the by-product that is left over from the processing of sugar beets, they extract the sugar, and what's left<br />is beet pulp (usually fed to pigs as it's cheap), but in dogs (which are carnivores) it's INDIGESTIBLE & produces gas (which<br />can cause gastric torsion - fatal if not caught & repaired via a DVM surgery in time) and beet pulp produces a FALSELY firm<br />stool, causing you to believe that your beloved dog is healthy because he's pooping some firm poops.<br /><br />No, the dog can't digest the beet pulp, it dehydrates the dog & passes through like a bale of hay....<br /><br />A good dog food contains WHOLE ingredients (not meal), no fillers, no soy, corn or wheat, whole fruits & veggies, no<br />salt and should contain whole turkey or chicken, whole herring and cottage cheese.  Your dog does not need salt if<br />the food contains whole veggies, potatoes, whole fish or cottage cheese, as those foods naturally contain salt.<br /><br />Natura Pet makes Evo (grain free), Innova, California Natural, and their pet food (cat, dog, ferret) contain 100%<br />HUMAN GRADE ingredients... ""natural"" means nothing.  Natura sells to mom & pop pet food stores, not chains or<br />supermarkets, because their food is preservative free, very tasty & HIGHLY caloric, so feed 1/2 the amount that<br />you would normally feed.  On Evo & on Innova your dog will poop 75--50% less stool volume because there's no<br />fillers and it's digestible.  These foods produce a glorious coat & even the pickiest eater will eat them.  Don't<br />supplement with canned food or other items, you won't need them.<br /><br />My Borzoi would spit out filet mignon scraps if they were cold, not sauteed in butter.  LOL!

This coffee has barely any flavor, only a hint of what I originally tasted. It seems diluted or something.

It is not just a slight difference, it is a complete overhaul.  It is more like Pep-O-Mint with an overpowering chemical flavor.  It seems someone at the company must have decided since some people like ""conspicuously strong mints"" we should sell them.  Unfortunately instead of leaving my favorite flavor Life Saver alone and coming out with a new strong mint, they made the foolish decision to re-flavor these.  I actually started choking on them it was so bad.  I thought it was just a mistake (I've had Pep-O-Mint occasionally mixed in a pack of Wint-O-Green or Spear-O-Mint before), but I quickly realized no, it is just the ""new and [not] improved"" flavor.  I've contacted the company previously (when they started adding artificial sweetener to some of the regular flavors) and they told me that their ""taste tests"" revealed that folks preferred the new flavor.  I think they must have found a test panel of folks who like the aftertaste of artificial sweetener.  I'm going to complain to the company again, but it will probably once again fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW [based on the original flavor Spear-O-Mint, which I also gave 5 stars]<br />These have become extremely hard to find.  It seems that the stores believe there is only a market for sugarless mints.

End result was: it was just too salty to tolerate.  I tasted a teaspoon of this and could tell right away.  I roll the jar label over and notice that, low and behold, it's got 190mg of sodium PER SERVING.  Considering one serving is two tablespoons, that's a heck of a lot of salt for one little jar.  In fact, 1/4th of the jar would just contain salt.  I don't see how this is a healthy option at all!  It's a good thing that I'm young and don't have any cardiac problems or high blood pressure because if I did, this stuff would just make it worse!  And at 4.99 per bottle, that's an expensive mistake to make, food-wise.  My advice is just to skip it!  Get the nonsweetened nonsalted peanut butter instead and have that with jam.

A few days ago I opened a new box and discovered they have made changes in this product.  What a shock. I absolutely hate the new product.  I do not like the taste, I do not like the color, I do not like the slimy texture in milk. I loved the old Special K Protein Plus. I liked the taste.  I Liked the color.  I liked the texture.  I looked forward to it every day.  It was a great way to begin my day.  Now I am in misery.  It's as if my best friend is no longer here.<br /><br />And I looked at the nutrition information and see that they have reduced the fiber from 5 grams to 3 grams per serving, a reduction of 40 percent.  And they increased the sugar from 2 grams to 7 grams per serving, an increase in dangerous empty calories by 250%. I do not need more sugar in my life.<br /><br />And the front of the box states ""satisfies hunger longer--see side panel for details. I looked at the side panel and it says ""Special K Protein products are designed to promote a reduced feeling of hunger by increasing daily intake of protein and fiber"".  So they added this statement to the new box while at the same time they reduced fiber by 40%.  And they also reduced the amount of protein in the box by about 10% because they changed the serving size.  The old box had 13.2 servings and the new box only 11.96 servings.  Fool me once.

Of the 12 cans, only 2 arrived undamaged.  Another 2 had small dents, which shouldn't affect the product or make opening the cans a problem.  Unfortunately, the 8 remaining cans are too badly dented to use.  Dents deep enough to have bent the cans sideways, and in the case of top dents, probably make it difficult/impossible to fully open with can opener. These will be discarded. Since some of the cans are dented on the top while others on the bottom, and the two undented cans were on an OUTSIDE row and the most severely dented on the INSIDE row, it appears that the cans were dented prior to packaging and not damaged in shipping.<br /><br />It is disappointing to see that damaged product is still a problem so many months after the first reviews called attention to the issue but an Amazon customer service rep. promised that someone would look into the issue to try to ascertain just where the damage is happening.  I haven't actually tried the pumpkin in the any of the 4 'safe' cans yet, so my review isn't based on the actual quality of the pumpkin but given the outrageously bad condition of the packaging there's no way I could rate this higher."

B001OCKIBY,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,Margaret Picky,0,0,1,2009-06-24,"Mr. Peanut, shame on you!","I was all excited to get these Planters Big Triple Nut Bars because the photo on the box looks like crispy peanut brittle studded with giant almonds and cashews. Even better, there's my good friend Mr. Peanut tipping his top hat with one white-gloved hand, holding his cane at a jaunty angle in the other. He's got such a big grin on his face, I know he's winking at me from behind that monocle! Yes, the box says ""chewy granola bars"", but I thought that would mean that they are both delicious AND healthy.<br /><br />Wrong! Mr. Peanut, how could you do this to me?<br /><br />First of all, the packaging is very deceptive. The box could hold 10 or 11 bars instead of 5. Yes, it's more than twice the volume of the product it holds and that is deceptive. The photo of the bar itself is enlarged approximately 100% so maybe that was the excuse. In reality, the bars are very small, weighing a tad over 1 1/2 ounces each and measuring about 1 1/4 inches wide by 4 3/4 inches long by 5/8 of an inch thick.<br /><br />The smell is okay, like roasted peanuts, pretty much what you would expect.<br /><br />But what about the taste?<br /><br />The flavor is pretty much one note, peanuts. That's the only thing I could taste. Normally, that would be a good thing because I love peanuts! Unfortunately, the peanuts taste stale and have an unpleasant aftertaste. The bars are also way too sweet and much too salty. (I had to brush my teeth and use mouthwash both to get rid of the taste.)<br /><br />I couldn't see any cashews or almonds in the bar at all. I did finally find one and a half very small almonds buried inside as I broke off each bite looking for the nuts. I couldn't identify any cashews by sight or by taste and I could identify the almonds only by sight and by the slight crunch, no almond flavor either.<br /><br />The texture (other than the tiny crunch from the almonds) is like soft peanuts mixed with cornmeal and coated in sticky soft goo. I really didn't enjoy the texture at all, it just didn't feel good on my teeth when biting down.<br /><br />I'm not surprised I couldn't tell the cashews from the peanuts but I couldn't even tell the oats from the peanuts by texture or taste and barely by sight because of the sticky goo.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know what was worse, the soft sticky texture or the cheap bitter peanut taste or the overwhelming sweetness or the heavy saltiness.<br /><br />Actually, I do know what is worse than all of that: the ingredient list and nutrition information. The box touts the 7 grams of protein but neglects to highlight the 12 grams of fat and 23 grams of carbohydrates. (An ounce is a little over 28 grams so that's quite a bit of fat and sugar.)<br /><br />The one good thing I see is a lot of vitamin E because of the tocopherols added as a flavor preservative.<br /><br />Other things that bother me are that the crisped rice is rice flour, sweeteners are listed eight times, and almonds and cashews are listed just before the under-1.5% ingredients. Since peanuts aren't really nuts (they're legumes), I think putting ""Big Nut Bars"" and ""Triple Nut"" on the package is very deceptive given the scarcity of the cashews and almonds and calling them granola bars is a bit of a stretch as well.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Peanuts<br />Corn syrup<br />Crisped rice (rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, caramel color, mixed tocopherols)<br />Peanut butter (roasted ground peanuts)<br />Sugar<br />Evaporated cane juice invert syrup<br />Whole grain rolled oats<br />Almonds<br />Cashews<br /><br />Contains less than 1.5% of:<br /><br />Whey (from milk)<br />Soy lecithin<br />Salt<br />Honey<br />Vegetable oil (peanut and/or cottonseed oil)<br />Resistant corn dextrin<br />Granola (whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain wheat, coconut, canola oil, wheat bran)<br />Xanthan gum<br />Mixed tocopherols<br /><br />Nutrition Information:<br /><br />Serving size one bar (46g or 1.62 oz)<br />Calories 220<br />Calories from Fat 100<br />Total fat 12g (18% of daily value)<br />Saturated fat 1.5g (8% of daily value)<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Polyunsaturated fat 3.5g<br />Monounsaturated fat 6g<br />Cholesterol 0%<br />Sodium 230mg 10%<br />Total carbohydrates 23g 8%<br />Dietary fiber 3g 12%<br />Sugars 13g<br />Protein 7g 7%<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 6%<br />Vitamin E 110%<br />Phosphorus 10%<br /><br />It may seem silly to give such a long review of these candy bars but I really felt let down by Planters, Kraft, and especially Mr. Peanut. I know these aren't gourmet brands but my experience is that they have consistently decent quality. It really seems like this product was just an excuse to use up low-quality and leftover ingredients by creating a sweet, salty snack food to make people fat and give them diabetes and cavities. Offhand, I can't think of a less enjoyable way to eat 220 calories especially when almost half of them are from fat.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Mr. Peanut, but I think it is kinder to be honest with you because we've been friends for such a long time. I would want you to tell me if I didn't taste good to you, either!"

I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.

Scherner,0,1,1,2012-09-21,"If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash","Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach."
B000F4EU52,A38DUAG2FRUMBK,David Daniel,8,9,1,2009-06-04,Not Safe!,After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!

With my regular brewer I have made my own half caff by blending a Starbucks caff and decaf for years. When I got my Keruig I thought this half-caff product would be the best answer for me, but it isn't. This tastes like a mixture of weak coffee and dishwater. Why Green Mountain put this out is a mystery. Green Mountain has a good caff coffee called Dark Magic and a good decaf coffee called Dark Magic Decaf. All they would have to do is use half of each of these in a K-cup and they would have an excellent half-caf. I know because I have a 20 ounce mug that I have brewed 9.5 ounces of each of these together and the taste is great. The only explanation for this Green Mountain half-caff product is that they must think that anyone who would buy a half-caf probably doesn't care much about taste, so they can use two cheaper coffees. Half-caff coffee drinkers DO care about taste. Message to Green Mountain: Give us a 50:50 mixture of the Dark Magic caff and Dark Magic decaff coffees, call it Dark Magic Half Caff so people will know what it is,  and deep six this product."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

BTW I discovered you can reuse the grounds from this process one more time with only a little reduction in quality if you make the second cup right away. You can stretch your Kopi dollars this way since you are spending about 7$ a cup."

It did improve my burn very much and I was sold! So I read up about Manuka honey and went and bought Wedderspoon 16+. It was LESS effective than the non-name 5+ jar. However, then I tried some local raw wildflower honey and it was just as effective as the 5+, and tasted better, and was a lot cheaper...<br /><br />The NIH tested four types of raw honey. They found that Manuka did have a higher level of antibacterial properties, but it was not as high as something called mountain honey. They didn't specify which mountain and also didn't indicate the level of Manuka. Also, ALL honey clears skin blemishes. Manuka may be better for internal problems as stated - I don't know about that - but I'm sticking with the local raw stuff for $10 a jar. I think wildflower honey is the best because who knows where the manuka bees go anyway? They probably go all over the place unless they are confined.<br /><br />Also, the UMF stands for ""Unique Manuka Factor"" ??? Seriously?? Why is it that they have a scientific explanation for the benefits of other honeys but not for the ""special"" benefits of manuka? Maybe the anti bacterial effects don't break down but then why not just go with local honey? What's so difficult about doing a chemical analysis of manuka against other honeys and finding the difference?<br /><br />So I say that if you have money to burn, definitely support your favorite New Zealand honey farmer! Why not? Otherwise you can find a better deal LOL!"

No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good.

It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.

B009GHI5Q4,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,6,15,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

B0031UBWLM,AZ80XGWSRV879,grnmolly,13,13,1,2012-07-08,I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed,"After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error."

Additionally, upon further inspection the k-cups looked a little dirty. It appeared that they had collected dust. Not sure if this was due to the packaging or simply bad product. I guess that's about it. I can't really speak to the actual coffee itself since I didn't try it.<br /><br />I should be fair and say, upon calling amazon with my concern they were happy to refund me entirely and asked that I dispose of the product since it's a non-returnable item.

It doesn't seem that this is a company who cares about their customer loyalty and longevity.

Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts?<br /><br />I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills.<br /><br />It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description.

The ginger is there but it's subtle & not over-powering. The cookie is just a bit chewy, which is nice for texture.<br /><br />Although I could recommend the cookies on taste alone, I can't recommend them due to the condition in which they were received. The chocolate had melted & re-hardened at some point, perhaps more than once. The cookies were stuck together, and the chocolate was mis-formed. To make matters worse, the chocolate had bloomed & had the tell-tale signs of white. Chocolate bloom is characteristic of storing chocolate in warm conditions and of improperly tempering chocolate.<br /><br />Moreover, the manufacturer placed a batch sticker (050411) over the nutritional information on the back of the box. I attempted to peel back the sticker but still could not read nutritional information because the sticker did not come off. I have no idea how many calories are in the product, much less fat grams or fiber grams. Because the FDA required that nutritional facts are displayed on convenience foods sold in the US, a food manufacturer really should know better than to slap batch stickers over nutritional information. Likewise, Amazon should know better than to make improperly marked food products available for sale.<br /><br />I give these cookies 4* for the taste but took off 2* for condition.

You'd better be careful too since baby won't taste it and you may not find it before it's really bad! I feel so sorry for my baby since I know it's really bad to her health, much worse then giving her non-organic cereal. I won't ever buy the product again no matter how my baby likes it.

We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself.

Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.

We have switched to Carnation Instant Breakfast and at times, plain old Hershey's Syrup!  We used to buy three cans each of Chocolate and Malt Ovaltine, every few weeks, but we will not buy more until the recipe is changed back to the original.  This change was so very upsetting to our family.  My kids only liked Ovaltine in their milk.<br /><br />This change was unnecessary, uncalled-for and is ruining the brand name Ovaltine after so many generations of loyalty.

In the past the instructions were in English on the packet but I don't recall what they were. Now it is entirely in German and no one I know speaks a word of the language. I don't have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested won't work.  Don't buy before realizing that if you don't speak German and have no one to translate you are in a pickle.. I have 10 packs now!  Another thing, all 10 packs expire in 6 months time, so don't buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten.

Neither my husband nor I could finish one mug of this stuff, and we will end up getting rid of the box.  It was that awful. There was none of the subtle spice blending--just a watery slightly clove-tasting flavor undercut by a bitterness that almost had hints of coffee. Adding a little milk, as we usually do, didn't help at all.  If you enjoy chai, I'd recommend Bigalow or Tazo and skip this one."

The filter prevents the coffee maker from completely sealing once it is placed in Senseo coffee maker, so once you clamp down lid and press botton to make coffee it leaks hot water all over the place, making a big mess.  Also, the rich foamy coffee you get with Senseo pods is nowhere to be seen.  I used Starbucks. It did not foam up and it was weak, weak,weak.  The podfilter was fully loaded with coffee. Even on the 1 cup setting the coffee was weak.  FOLKS YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM.  IT'S NO WONDER.

Once you are able to get the thin cello off the licorice you are met with very hard, and impossible to take the licorice apart to eat. What little you could break off was hard and stale. Very disappointed in the product and am even more disappointed with the way the company has handled it (or I should say hasn't handled it) I contacted them and they haven't bothered responding to my correspondance. We paid a premium price for the licorice 8.99 a package and ended up throwing out the total product because it was simply unacceptable and impossible to enjoy. So, on two notes , I would be cautious about ordering from them, because there is a chance they won't bother to answer your correspondance and secondly the product they delivered us wasn't remotely like the old fashioned spearmint licorice that we enjoyed as kids. Be warned."

It was weak, and bitter.  And did not have the same sort of buttery texture that can be produced with Sumatra pods for example.  I have an older model at home and the new model at work with an espresso holder.  The newer model makes a slightly but noticeably better coffee.  In neither case will you get an actual espresso but is a far cry better than drip coffee.  So far I have found the Sumatra blend pods provide the best results for those who are trying to get the texture and flavor of espresso."

B000HDGIDS,A16AQTGC1K11I6,Cloud Gazer,15,23,1,2008-07-04,"Brand is otherwise great, but Amazon sent me a batch with Black Mold","I buy this brand from a local store in bulk.  I was trying to save myself some time and hassle by buying it through Amazon (about same price either way as my local store).  But after this shipment (and a totally separate different food item shipped from Amazon *on the same order* that also had health/quality issues), I cannot recommend buying this from Amazon.<br /><br />I was sent the case pack, wrapped in heavy plastic which was packaged neatly in a cardboard box.  When I pulled out the plastic-wrapped case, it was extremely obvious that these cans had burst... and had done so some time ago b/c an enormous amount of black mold had grown inside the plastic wrap.  Why this wasn't caught by their people, I don't know.  (I'm on ""prime""; so, I get my shipments in 2 days or less...not enough time to have the mold grow that much.)<br /><br />Anyway, I did open the plastic surrounding the case of cans to inspect further.  I found that at least 4 cans had burst, and, of course, the stench was horrible.  I tossed the entire batch in the garbage.  There was no way I was chancing my family's health on this one.<br /><br />NOTE: (1) This item was fulfilled by Amazon, not a different seller.  (2) The boxes in which these were shipped was not damaged, not even a small dent.  (3) The cans were not dented, either.  This case was not damaged during shipment.  Whatever caused the cans to burst appears to be the result of an error during ""Farmer's Market"" manufacturing.  Furthermore, my assertion is that Amazon's people should have noticed the obvious black mold.<br /><br />[Edited to add: Initially (and after talking briefly with a doctor/scientist about these cans), I was given the impression that the burst cans were a result of botulism.  The scientist is the one who used that term with me b/c it had not occurred to me prior to the conversation.  Alarmed, I used the term in my original review w/o referencing the aforementioned conversation.  I have since removed the term.  Regardless, black mold is toxic (more so than green molds), and this experience was health and safety issue.]<br /><br />I will say that Amazon did give me my money back without a major hassle.<br /><br />In my experience WRT household/grocery items, it appears that Amazon gets good pricing from companies for stuff that doesn't meet that company's upper level quality control standards.  Besides all the great books, toys, electronics and more, I order several household items from Amazon.  Most of the items in this ""household/grocery"" category aren't edible/food items. I do notice minor differences in quality on these other household items.  For the most part, I can overlook them.  But on food?  No way.<br /><br />(To be clear: Other items such as books, electronics, toys have usually been just fine.)<br /><br />To sum up, when I say ""tread warily"" I'm suggesting that you just be careful and pay closer attention than you otherwise would when you order this (and perhaps other food items) from Amazon.<br /><br />Your experience may vary, and I hope it does."

When I visited my doctor I was told I had high blood pressure. I asked why for 66 years my blood pressure was normal but now it was high and I needed 2 prescriptions. Doctor said that was normal. Since I like to research I found that the crystals I was using had Aspartame, one of the most dangerous artificial sweeteners. Side effects include headaches, anxiety, abdominal pain, nausea, heart palpitations, irritable bowel syndrome & high blood pressure. Acesulfame potassium is another artificial sweetener used in some Crystal Light varieties. This sweetener contains methylene chloride, which is a known carcinogen - long-term use of this carcinogen may cause cancer. Other side effects include nausea, headaches and impaired liver.<br /><br />I stopped using anything with Aspartame(threw out the prescriptions)and my blood pressure is now normal. The ""Natural"" crystal light is not really natural because it contains Aspartame(which I was told is also genetically modified). Crystal Light has a very good product called ""Natural"". It uses cane sugar (not GM sugar beet) & TRUVIA. This is a much better product and only a few calories more than the ""Natural"" which is not really natural. Aspartame is not natural. Many other synthetically sweetened products use Aspartame. You have to read all labels.

I recently tried using chili powder (not this one from Amazon, but one from a grocery store), and didn't feel like paying the higher price per pound buying it from a grocery store, so I found the one here on Amazon. There is an ingredient in here that I am not fond of whatsoever, hence the 1 star review.

They said Amazon writes the listing (Lies) and to contact them.<br />I called Amazon, they said no, they couldn't possibly be responsible for the misprint on the ad, as they sell millions oof products for tens of thousands of companies, and each company writes their own ads for their own products. (Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller.<br />After several more ""going nowhere"" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Amazon, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded.<br /><br />Amazon ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping.<br /><br />I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again.

I use a Sweetwise mat to roll out my fondant in most cases. Fondarific stuck to the mat. We're talking disaster. Thankfully I was able to repair the bulk of the problems (and there were TONS of them)with shortening. Either way, the finish wasn't as clean as I would have liked...something that's NEVER been a problem with Satin Ice, Chocopan or my MMF.<br />2. I was expecting awesome taste, but this tasted like wax, Wilton, and Chocopan mixed together. Thankfully the slight Chocopan taste saved it taste wise, but this stuff doesn't hold a candle to Satin Ice in the taste department. My kids, who like MMF and Satin Ice, HATE - and I mean HATED - Fondarific.<br />3. I had some smaller accents to cover, so I rolled out the Fondarific in the traditional way...i.e. no mat. The stuff was sooooooo sticky and by the time I got enough powdered sugar down to keep this stuff from sticking- it was dried out to the point where it was almost useless. Sure, there was no elephant skin, but it felt more like gumpaste that had started to harden.<br />4. The texture after being rolled onto the cake was off. I always hear about people saying they don't like how fondant feels in their mouth, but my MMF and Satin Ice had changed my friends' and family members' opinions. Sadly- Fondarific even had me gagging and peeling the fondant off my slice.<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I will NEVER use this again. Thankfully I was able to save the cake and it still came out looking good, but it was a struggle every step of the way."

The texture is great (nice and crunchy...though it makes me think a little of pet food XD ), and the fiber content is super. But the aspartame is a dealbreaker for me. I used to consume aspartame (in chewing gum and 1-4 cans of diet coke a day) and discovered that it was actually giving me migraines and hiking up my anxiety level (haven't had a migraine or panic attack in 4 years since quitting it). If I accidentally get some, I get headaches and start feeling nervous right away... So, while the studies on brain tumors is controversial, I avoid it like the plague.<br /><br />But I found today a wonderful alternative to Fiber One is Smart Bran. It has a whopping 13+ grams of fiber and tastes pretty good without the nasty artificial sweeteners. It also doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. It would be lovely if General Mills changed their Fiber One to be healthier. 10-20 calories less in a cereal isn't worth headaches and other health impacts from Aspartame...plus it's nice when cereal has a decent aftertaste."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

There were some annoyance issues with its functionality (no beeping or alert to let you know when steaming is finished, smaller capacity which meant that one large sweet potato needed to be split into two steaming batches, and the fact that you have to hold the dial continuously during the puree stage or it turns off).<br /><br />While I could probably live with those factors, I became concerned when I read reviews from other parents regarding mold and other materials in the reservoir. I got out a flashlight and decided to look at the reservoir. Although I had followed the instructions to run the machine through three steam cycles before you begin using it, the reservoir contained brown liquid spots in the bottom. I used a paper towel to try and get out the spots. The liquid was some sort of chemical lubricant.<br /><br />If you wish to use this product, please make sure that you check the reservoir with a flashlight before and after each use.

Described as being able to nourish the scalp deeply and to seal in moisture, Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm seemed to be a product that would work well for me.  Regular color ""refreshment"" and age have dried my hair so that I need a good, deep conditioning product.  Unfortunately, it left my hair greasy, dirty-looking, and weighed down by its residue.<br /><br />My first clue that this was not the product for me should have been the ingredient list - paraffin is the primary component.  Upon opening the jar, I thought that someone had filled it with beeswax that is used as furniture polish and to seal wooden kitchenware. Unfortunately, what the description omitted was that Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm was, according to the label, for ""Relaxed and Natural"" hair.  Had there been more information provided, I would have chosen another product.  Nevertheless, I attempted to use it in hopes that I would get a better result than some of the other reviewers.<br /><br />Women who do use chemical relaxers or have natural hair may find this product useful.  Those whose hair is fine and straight like mine will probably want to avoid Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm.<br /><br />Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm has a pleasant fragrance.  I discovered it does work well as a hand cream.  I found that just touching my finger tips to the surface and then rubbing my hands together, my skin was smooth and soft.  I believe it may also work well to prevent hangnails and dried cuticles.  For me and despite its alternative usefulness as a hand cream, Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm is a one-star product.  If you have relaxed or natural hair, you may rate this product more favorably."

I was able to, quite easily, slip off the remaining ""end"" of the bone and noted due to the shape( hole in the end) had it slipped into Gerry's throat--- hole end in ---it would've created a vacuum and the outcome might have been fatal.

This ""coffee"" has a wonderful aroma as it brews, but it has no taste at all.  In fact, while I can smell the pumpkin spice, I can not distinguish the taste of this stuff from simple hot water.  To give it any flavor at all, I need to add a creamer and/or some sugar to it, or maybe even a little brandy.  That is a very bad thing (not the brandy), since I like my coffee black without any additives at all.<br /><br />If Green Mountain wants to make a mild ""flavored"" coffee rather than a medium or bold flavor, that's ok, but the very least they should do is use their breakfast blend as a starting point and work from there with their various spices. Until then, I'm sorry, but as much as I would like to do so, I can not recommend this product to anyone who likes the taste of coffee."
B009GHI5Q4,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,7,9,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

There appears to be little or no actual yeast in this so-called ""yeast"".<br /><br />Update May 2012:<br /><br />I have been experimenting with this brand of yeast by trying to activate in the following manner.  Take one packet (about two teaspoons), add 1/4 teaspoon of sugar and 1/4 cup of water between 110 and 120 degrees.  Put it in a coffee cup and get it all nice and wet and wait about five minutes.  Red Star brand and Fleischmans (regular and fast rising) and the Hodgson Mill yeast in their bread machine mixes (the only other ones I have checked) yeast will rise and fill half the coffee mug.  (Fast risers fill the whole cup)  This brands increases its volume by just a little.<br /><br />I have also found that Red Star (regular, did not try the fast rise) yeast that is more than one year past its expiration date performs nearly as well as the fresh stuff.  Therefore I can say with the confidence of empirical evidence that Red Star yeast that is more than one year past the expiration on the package performs better (read: acceptable) than the packets of unexpired SAF yeast I have tried (read: unacceptable)."

B001VIYCK4,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,33,48,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

B000LKZLPS,AY6TK80W3N0KF,Rutherford,6,6,1,2010-02-18,BPA lined cans means not really organic anymore once processed,"I chose Westbrae's canned beans because they are organic. However, since then I've discovered that Westbrae uses cans with BPA in the lining.<br /><br />With BPA lining the cans and research showing solid levels of the chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams (from infants to the elderly), I don't think the product can still be called organic!<br /><br />BPA leeching into our food is no better or safer than products sprayed with pesticides.<br /><br />At least pesticides can be washed off many foods (not all, but some). Most people, though, just empty cans of foods, like beans and tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash soup?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods. They believe it is safe to use the foods as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed.<br /><br />I know I quit adding salt to my own recipes containing canned foods many years ago, because the canned goods already had salt in them. The canning process is supposed to kill bacteria and preserve nutrition, just as home canning does. It wasn't until the information came out about BPA in our bloodstreams, and from where most of us are exposed to it, that I realized there was a problem using such foods as is. There are still many Americans who do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.<br /><br />There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful.<br /><br />Until Westbrae stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context."

I bought several to keep at my office, unfortunately, these Noodle Bowls are just barely edible in my opinion.<br /><br />The first one I tried was late last year.  They were the Teriyaki Noodles and after trying to convince myself that it wasn't 'that bad', I finally tossed it after just several bites.  I refused to touch the other bowls in my desk after that experience but also didn't throw them out because it seemed like such a waste.  Today, out of hunger and laziness, I finally tried the Kung Pao Noodle Bowl.  While I did find this one to be more palatable and finished all but just a few bites, it really isn't something I could recommend to anyone.<br /><br />The Teriyaki Sauce and Noodles were just gross.  The Kung Pao Sauce was at least tasty but the Noodles were still funky.  Basically, the noodles are pre-cooked and vacumed sealed for you.  Out of their packaging, they smell like playdoh and they look weird - like soft rubber - not like a food item.  You add boiling water (or microwave them with water) to basically re-heat them, drain and add the sauce.  I love the concept but that weird playdoh smell just never disapears and I find it hard to convince my brain that I'm actually eating noodles and not some weird inorganic product.  With the Kung Pao noodles, I chose to use boiling water (over the microwave method I used the first time) and after straining the noodles I repeated the process a second time with more boiling water to better 'rinse' the noodles.  This seemed to get rid of the weird smell a bit more and the sauce was flavorful enough that it covered up most of the remaining weird noodle smell taste.<br /><br />The last one I have in my drawer is the Pad Thai flavor.  I'm in no rush to try it but of course, won't throw it out (I hate being wasteful like that) but once it's gone, I will not be purchasing any more Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls."

You can see bits of garlic, onion and (minimal) spices in the sauce but the flavor has been completely boiled out of it to point that all that's left the bitter part of the garlic and the acidic part of the tomatoes.

For the past two years, I have been purchasing my gluten free oat bran from Canada and have been very pleased with the quality of the product and their customer service.  However, I thought I would try this company to minimize my shipping costs.<br />I received the product quickly; however, when I opened the plastic bag which contained the oat bran, there was a faint, but distinct, odor that I can only describe as sour milk.<br /><br />I notified the company via e-mail through their website and questioned what I might be smelling and whether I received oats that may have gone rancid.  When I did not receive an answer after a few days, I notified them again and added my complaint of poor customer service.  I received an e-mail and a telephone message assuring me that their oats were fresh and had a shelf life of another eight months.  She further explained that they were raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oats and very nutritious.<br /><br />Okay, I thought, so maybe oats that are raw, unsteamed, unprocessed and nutritious have an offensive odor. I am always open to eating foods in their most natural state.  For a few days, I ate the oat bran each morning even though it had a sour, as well as a sweet taste that I am not accustomed to.  I e-mailed the company again to let them know that the odor and taste did not seem right to me.  I asked if they would describe to me the odor of raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oats; but after a week, they have not responded.<br /><br />So either raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oat bran smells like sour milk and has a sour/sweetish taste or the oat bran that I received was rancid.

They don't hold up to any pressure. There were some cones already broken in the wrapper. I don't know if I just got a bad batch or where the problem originates, but these are a little expensive to not be completely happy with them. I really don't like throwing 2 to 3 cones away for every one that I able to delicately fill with ice cream. I guess I will have to look for another brand...I love ice cream cones too much to give up!

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell. I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping. As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant. Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetner could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market. The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetner* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little.  I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ... it's the maltitol!"

If you are looking for flat out strong flavor and ""kick"" then the 2.8 oz is probably your favorite.  I prefer the smooth and flavorful but subtle first harvest.  It's expensive but they are both relatively very expensive.  You are paying for the health and flavor quality and the absence of offensive taste which is hard to find in matcha.

He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb."

I was trying to find a product that would work on my Nespresso C-100 Essenza machine but at a more affordable price than the Nespresso capsules. Ethical coffee capsules seemed to be the right product. I soon encountered several issues. First, it was difficult to close the lid of the machine with the capsules inside. Secondly, the coffee that came out was watered down and tasted quite bad. On close examination of the capsules after  using them, I noticed that the machine only superficially perforated the capsule, which would explain why the coffee was so watered down. Thus, I decided to make small holes on the capsules prior to inserting them into the machine. That did help, but the coffee quality was still bad. Even if the coffee was great, I really should not have to place holes on the capsules prior to inserting them into the machine in order for the water to go through it freely!! These Ethical coffee capsules either ARE compatible with Nespresso machines or THEY ARE NOT!  Based on my experience, I must say that these ARE NOT compatible with Nespresso makers. Conclusion: spend a little more money and purchase the Nespresso capsules for your machine. They are worth the extra money. Nespresso capsules work beautifully and the coffee is great. Thanks!"

Consequently, sometimes you get a full cup that is mostly water -- then you might get half a cup.  There is NO consistency in how much coffee will actually come out -- or how strong/weak the coffee will be.  I can't tell if it's manufacturing irregularities or whether the pods are just poorly designed.  In any event, only about one in five pods actually produces a drinkable full cup of coffee.  I emailed Aloha Island Coffee Company with my concerns and asking for advice, but have not yet received an answer after two weeks.<br /><br />I'm going back the the Douwe Egberts pods -- at least they are consistent and A LOT less expensive."

So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply.

The drink also left a yucky aftertaste, much like the diet drinks of old that contained saccharin.<br /><br />On the positive, it contains a lot of vitamins, which is probably why it tastes so awful. However, I would rather pop a vitamin pill than drink this again. And while it claims to boost your energy, it contains caffeine, which may have something to do with that.<br /><br />If you really want to try this, I highly recommend that you hold your nose and chug it down. Then, eat something or chew gum to get rid of the aftertaste. As an alternative, I recommend taking a multivitamin with a glass of water.

The name means ""head of the shop""--it's a blend of up to 100 spices and every place has a slightly different formula. With all six, we got a mild, aromatic, subtly perfumy seasoning with a tremendous depth of flavor. We love it on steamed lamb shanks. It has an outstanding affinity for whole roast chicken: brush melted butter all over the chicken, then coat generously with ras el hanout and a little salt and pepper. Roast at 365° for 1 hour and 45 minutes, turning it over after the first hour. Fabulous! Ras el hanout is about the same color as cumin.

B001NJGA7Y,AS1GR7GQUZR8C,amazonshopper,1,3,1,2009-07-13,"Quality problem, Unknown sediments","We just had 4 cases of these from amazon and these are NOT the same as 11.2 oz ones. There are numerous brown specks or particles floating in the drink if you look it closely under the light. We didn't discover this until we realized that the drink did something funny to our stomachs afterwards. The constitution is much murkier than previous 11.2 oz packages and doesn't taste the same. We think this has a different processing procedure than the 11.2 oz packages. Maybe it has to do with the factory filtration system or even a serious quality control problem. As with all other food imports, very few are actually sample tested by FSIS/DOA for safety or against the ingredients listed by the manufacturer. Any feedback to us from other reviewers is encouraged. We'd like to know what these brownish particles are and why they are there. If you find it exactly the same as 11.2 oz ones, let other readers know too. For now, we'd suggest you go test one in a local supermarket and see if it's to your liking and compare these with 11.2 oz ones."

The aftertaste is especially gross. Doesn't smell so hot either. I'm not a blue box fan, but that's at least edible at times. This one, not so much. I even tasted everything separate and checked my milk since it was a new carton...maybe that was bad? No. Tasted the plain noodle left in the strainer...that was ok.

B003MWBFMK,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,7,9,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

I tried complaining via the Healthy Choice website today, only to have their servers fail twice before it wiped my complaint.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOUP.<br /><br />I have never been so dissatisfied with food before I ate this soup.  I'm the type that will say, ""eh, it doesn't taste good, but I bought it, so I'll eat it,"" but miraculously I ate three spoonfuls before I gave up and tossed the rest in the trash.  Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.<br /><br />P.S.

You are making this cereal much less healthy by putting MORE SUGAR and LESS FIBER in it. Please change it back!!<br /><br />I don't understand why they are calling this a HEALTHY cereal, which it obviously IS NOT anymore. When you base your business decisions on the fact that people WANT SWEETER cereals, you are doomed to fail. You are neither HEALTHY nor FRUIT LOOPS. As a nutrition major, I know that some FAT...the right kind is good for us. It provides SATIETY, so we are satisfied with less and feel full faster.<br /><br />I would rather have a little MORE FAT and LESS SUGAR, which all of the experts know leads us down the road to increased diabetes and heart problems. Also, as a nutrition major, I know that in our society, PROTEIN deficiency is NOT a PROBLEM. We eat so much meat, chicken, fish, soybeans, tofu, we don't need more than 25 grams per day.<br /><br />I can see that Kellogg is not going to reformulate SPECIAL K, until the public DEMANDS IT, so count me as one person who will buy whatever remaining 5 g. of Fiber SPECIAL K that I can find and then I will get my cereal elsewhere and it WILL be HEALTHIER THAN SPECIAL K.

Let me warn you so you dont waste your money like I did - DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. #1, not even one of these products contains ANY Watermelon. They are all basically the same with Sugar, Lemon juice, Melon flavoring (NOT Watermelon), and red dye. NOT one single bit of Watermelon in any of them. #2, They dont taste even remotely like Watermelon, and in fact all but Best Bargain have disgusting taste to them. I tried various quantities of the syrup from very little to a lot - and either way, they taste horrible! #3, you can EASILY make your own delicious Watermelon syrup. There are a number of recipies on the web. Some require rendering (boiling down) but you dont have to use those to get a very good homemade, TRUE tasting syrup.<br /><br />Avoid these products like the plague!!!<br /><br />Note - Dunkin Donuts does not seem to sell their syrup, however you can go to their web site and click the ""Contact Us"" button and send them a note that you would like to purchase their syrup (if you like it - and it is the best) and if you have a local shop, you can ask the manager if he/she wouldnt mind buying an extra one for you!<br /><br />Otherwise, make your own!

B000R4CJQ2,AKZKG2Z7CNV27,BreezyPaige,7,10,1,2012-03-27,Absolutely Awful Cat Food,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler.  Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn."

I have tried numerous Loma Linda, Worthington, Morningstar Farms, Boca, etc protein or meat substitute products over the past 30 years, but this is without doubt the worst of them.<br />I ordered this product for shelf storage during the winter months since my freezer space is limited and thought it would be convenient to occasionally open a can to slice for burgers, or chop up for use in tacos, chili, casseroles, etc. I expected the quality would be similar to other Worthington and Loma Linda canned products. I have tried to use this product in these various ways for several months and it's just horrible and can't be disguised even in other dishes. I'm going to donate the remaining cans to local meals program. The problem is the taste and texture. It tastes burned right out of the can, and has a sandy/gritty or mealy texture that doesn't help. After much consideration, I would describe the taste as a concentrated, burned hamburger bun that caught some of the aroma or seasonings of a hamburger or veggie burger along the way.<br />I love Worthington and Loma Linda's other products and would quickly recommend them such as the canned veggie sausage links, Tender Bites, Burger, the frozen Morningstar Farms and Boca burgers, sausage and crumbles, etc. Redi-Burger though is so bad that it could make a vegetarian reconsider eating meat."

He took naps and ate food along the way. When he started to get tired he drank one 5 hour energy drink and arrived shortly after irritable and OUT OF CONTROL. He through a metal bar stool at my glass sliding doors of our new home. I thought he had calmed down so we went for a drive, he had a mood swing because I disagreed with him about something, he called himself stupid and started literally PUNCHING his own face while driving!!! He broke his glasses and started crying and gasping for air saying his heart was beating out of his chest. He then proceeded to do 108 MPH with our two young children in the back weaving on and off the road. He made an abrubt stop and got out. At that point I was scared to death and praying he would walk in front of a car. I started to dial 911 on my phone. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance as police feared he was having a stroke. They said drinking the 5 hour energy on a half empty stomach triggered a response when his saritonin levels started to fluctuate drastically causing possible suicidal/homicidal thoughts and frequent mood swings~ I was 25 years old at the time, my two children were 1 and 4 years old. We ALMOST died to a chemical imbalance that was caused by 5 HOUR ENERGY! Its IMPOSSIBLE to tell how a chemical will effect you, but with possible side effects as these, they are not worth the risk! I have currently filed a lawsuit against the company!"

Thankfully Amazon gave me a full refund for the DEFECTIVE Timothy Cups (all 4 cases). If you don't mind crunchy/chewy coffee, then Timothy's Decaf is for you...if not then you are going to be like me...looking for a tasty alternative Colombian Decaf from another manufacturer.

There are 14g of sugars per 2/3 cup serving. Some ingredients like the dried fruit and oats are hard while others like the cereal flakes are soft and absorb milk. If you let the hard parts soften up with milk the flakes turn into mush.<br /><br />Familia makes a lot of great cereals and I'm surprised they let this one out the door. They must think Americans are sugar-crazed Coca Cola addicts. I really like the Familia Low-Fat Musli and suggest you buy that instead.<br /><br />On the plus side this cereal has a lot of dried fruit.

Several cartons had a slow leak from the bottom and trying to figure out exactly which cartons were making the wet mess was difficult.  It turned out to be 4 of the 12 cartons, and since you have to refrigerate after the seal has been broken, I had to pour a third of my order down the drain.  Also, the little plastic pour spout/cap on the top of the carton had come off half of the cartons; I was able to hot-glue them back on, but that was very inconvenient.  I've NEVER gotten a leaking carton or faulty pour spout from the Rice Dream I buy at the grocery store, so in the future, I'll just have to make the long drive to the nearest store that carries this product."

These bars are maybe 1 1/2"" wide, 4"" long, and 1/4"" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know.

My mistake for not reading the reviews, but I disagree with the guy who said that the description covers the sellers behind when it comes to variety.  The description says that a buyer will get a ""wide variety"" and I hardly think 3 flavors comprising more than half of the package qualifies as ""wide variety"".  I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  If I would have bought these flavors on the Keurig website, I would have paid less per K-cup than I paid for this package... and I paid the higher price specifically for the variety.  I do not feel I got what I paid for and I think Amazon should not allow this seller to continue falsely advertising.<br /><br />Final note:  The K-cups came in a paper bag ... with no visible expiration dates.  One of them was punctured on top.  Considering some of the other reviews, I am worried about whether or not these K-cups are even good anymore.

This is NOT an issue of the product being bad.  It is an issue of the information given in the ad is misleading and untrue.  I cannot give it 5 stars, since I did NOT get what I expected to get, regardless of whether or not the bone is good. (I would not be leaving this feed back if this ad had been corrected. I asked that the ad be corrected, so that others are not misled too. I have waited over a week, and IT HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED! So I feel I must share this information with others.)<br /><br />I ordered this product because the ad said that the retail value was $57.60, at a cost of $1.72.  It goes on to say that you are saving 97%.  I should have known that it was UNTRUE, but I read on and the more I read, I began to believe that it was a closeout item, and a good deal.<br /><br />They talk about ""femur bones"" (PLURAL); and the shipping weight is ""1 pound;"" as well as, the picture shows you 3 bones. So I assumed at the very least I would get 3 bones, and it was a reasonable, if I got free shipping by meeting their minimum.  Since I could not envision 3 bones having a retail value was $57.60; so I ordered, the ""bones"" with the hope that there were more. I assumed that this must be a closeout, and I thought I was going to get a good deal.  WHAT I GOT was 1 femur bone, if I had known it was ONE bone, I would NOT have ordered. ONE bone with a retail value of $57.60?????<br /><br />To the company's credit, they did refund me when I complained about being misled by the information in the ad. I have not seen the correction on my billing yet, but I would assume that since they told me it was being issued, that it will be on my next statement.<br /><br />Please note: You are NOT getting a good buy, or what you think you will get when ordering this product.  Since you get ONE bone; I believe that this one 6 oz bone at $1.72, plus $5.49 shipping is too expensive.  You are paying($7.21) for one bone that would cost $2.00 or less at a pet store."

When I received the package it was not in the Cultures for Health package but rather in a plain bubble envelop in zip lock bag. I contacted the vendor to ask what was going on. The vendor responds: ""You have ordered and received kefir grains from Fermentation Cultures, we have no association with Cultures for Health.""<br /><br />So I say, ""If you have no association why does the the product description say: Water Kefir Grains by Cultures for Health LLC.""<br /><br />He responds, ""That is how amazon works, if I have to sell things similar to those that are already on amazon, they will place it this way.""<br /><br />What? Fermentation Cultures???<br /><br />I wrote to Cultures for Health and they were aware of this fraudulent use of their name and had contacted Amazon with no results.<br /><br />I have ordered many products from Amazon and this has never been the case. This drastically reduces my trust in Amazon. I asked Amazon to please explain what the seller means by ""that is how Amazon works,"" wanting to know if what he stated is true in any way.<br /><br />Amazon wrote: ""I'm sorry this has been a disappointing order experience for you; this doesn't normally happen."" What is it that doesn't normally happen? I never received a satisfactory explanation regarding this false advertising.<br /><br />Amazon did provide a refund but that is not my concern. I ordered frequently from Amazon and until this occurrence I was under the impression that sellers were offering products as advertised. I wanted to know if this is a routine practice of Amazon. And if not, why wouldn't Amazon have the faulty association removed from the product description? No answers. The seller's page is still up and the product description still proclaims it's by ""Cultures for Heath.""<br /><br />I have not purchased anything from Amazon for six months. I have found other sources for many routine items; this equates to many hundreds of dollars. I may consider a purchase here and there but Amazon failed big here.<br /><br />You can find the authentic product by doing a simple search; they do not sell on Amazon."

Crown Prince Brisling Sardines are smaller and taste just a bit better without the BPA. 15oz is three times the size of the small cans for much less money and a very good buy when I mix with other food ingredients since there is no way to buy any wild healthy fish like sardines which cost around $2.00 a pound from grocery stores. The junk farm raised fish with added carpet dye is sold for $10.00 a pound which is not healthy at all. I consume more Baltic sprats and herrings from Germany which are very tasty and delicious. Regardless of the type of fish, each can has some 1000~3000 MG of sodium which is not low so I drain the oil since vegetable oil is unhealthy, regardless of the type specified, and never trust when they claim olive oil either, as well as the tomato juice or water, to get ride of the unhealthy part of the can including the unhealthy salt and then consume the fish."

B001LGGH40,AO9UNKQG83BUP,Book Fan,5,7,1,2009-02-25,"Tastes like overly sweet apple juice, Trader Joe's version is better","Summary:  way too sweet, no berry/kiwi flavor, small serving.<br /><br />Upon first taste, both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness.  Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.<br /><br />Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.<br /><br />Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).<br /><br />By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say ""no *added* sugar"", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying ""no sugar"" or ""no sucrose"" (table sugar).<br /><br />disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one."

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs.  As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs.  Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic.  Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods.  This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat.  Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat.  A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke.  It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use.  Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business.  There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients.  I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back."

Also, if you do not use the drain feature and take some time to pump the water out of the inner heating chamber you will NOT be making coffee with fresh water! So if you have not done the chore of draining the machine, the water will be as old as the last time you brewed! I am going back to my old Kitchenaid Spa brewer, it does a fantastic job, the water is ALWAYS fresh as I do not have to drain the thing then put in more water!The Keurig made great coffee when it worked, but if you take the price of the machine and the price of the 45 cups of coffee I made the last 38 days that comes to $3.64 per cup to own it. Also,be SURE that you do not forget to turn off the power to the machine AFTER EACH use. If yours stops pumping water as mine has and has no water in the inner heating tank, my question is does it have a safety device that keeps it from overheating and causing a fire? Just wanted to give my honest review and make sure that these things are safe. UPDATE: After contacting Keurig and waiting a MONTH. NOTHING. This is one disgusting Company.

While I can get over that, every day I ate them I would bite into very hard orange crystaly bits which I have to assume aren't digestible. I'm not sure if Manitoba is addings these things as filler as a cheap means of increasing the weight or if they're getting mixed in by accident - in either case though it's unacceptable. I would not recommend this product and would probably not try it again. The extra monetary cost of Nutiva is certainly worth it to forego the filler. On the other hand, Amazon was amazing.

B001VIYCK4,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,7,9,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

I just checked the label and it is the same 78% moisture as is the cat food so I'm not sure what is wrong.  Plus, when I gave Joey just a tablespoon in his dry food, it made him sick.  The ingredients are so different than the dry and I don't understand that.  Why would they have such a variance in the ingredients of a food for sensitive dogs?!  Anyway, Joey loves the dry food and the Wellness salmon and rice both dry and canned.  Their canned is made with much more logic and has the same ingredients in a different order to make the canned.  That makes sense to me, not what Natural Balance has done with this."

I also work in the natural products industry at the senior level and have seen the deception first hand. Gluten is quite a serious issue as when it is consumed the villi are inpaired and other nutrients needed to be assimilated for other necessary body functions are not absorbed. It has caused my family other serious complications from eyesight to teeth and mouth difficulties and it has to stop. I am writing this reveiw because I am tired of feeling powerless while companies are prospering at the expense of our health. I follow a paleolithic diet for the most part and recently for my birthday decided to have a turkey sandwich on Udi's bagels. Well they are most certainly not gluten free. EVEN IF LESS THAN 5ppm still makes someone sick. My entire mouth broke out in canker sores and I got a white spot on my front tooth that has not gone away because the gluten sensitivity is preventing iron absorption. Udi's is making millions of dollars and people are getting sick even if they are not sensitive enough to feel it. We had the gluten tested at the doctor's and yep sure enough it was UDI's bread that we reacted to. I hope this review helps at least one other person not get sick."""

After chewing on the ""Twin Hoofers"" for just about 20 minutes, I noticed that they were coming apart into large, sharp pieces.  The women at the shop had said dogs can digest every part of the hooves, but I took them away because I wasn't comfortable with what was happening.<br /><br />By the next day, our dog was having horrible diarrhea and there were pieces of the hoof in it.  The morning after that, she vomited up several large, jagged pieces and then had so much blood in her stool that my boyfriend and I considered taking her to the vet.

About 98% of the time, this is the case for me however, with PepPod this is NOT the case.<br /><br />PepPod comes in a tablet form and dissolves in your cup of water. The directions on the packaging give you an option to tailor your flavor from strong to strongest. Strong is 16oz of water, Stronger is 8oz and Strongest is 8oz of water. None of this is listed on the online description. According to the reviews and the product description PepPod is not like any other energy drink. You get a burst of energy naturally; no jitters, jittery feeling, racing heartbeats, and a crash after it wear off. It also has 81mg of caffeine and says on the packaging that if you are ""sensitive"" to caffeine maybe you should consult with your physician.<br /><br />I made sure to try it when I was tired. I was on my way to my part-time job after already working an 8-hour day and took mine in 10oz to be on the safe side. I was so excited because I have been trying to find something like PepPod. About 30 mins after drinking my PepPod I started feeling sick, nausea, jittery feelings and even more tired than I did before I drink it. I am NOT a caffeine drinker. I do not drink coffee or soda but I wouldn't consider myself sensitive to Caffeine as I have in the past but maybe I am now because I do not drink it now and haven't in years. What I do know is this product made me sick, it was ineffective, and everything it claimed to do it did NOT! To the caffeine drinkers maybe the 81 MG and the other ingredients will not affect you. To the non-caffeine drinkers this will certainly affect you and 81 mg of caffeine is equivalent to a cup of coffee. I will NOT recommend this product to anyone I will be returning it."

Initially I purchased this product due to the price being cheaper than it's main competitor spry.  What a mistake that was.  Actually this product is no cheaper after you spend 4.99 on shipping and also count in the additional time you have to wait for the product (4 -5 days) to be delivered.  The product tastes great initially but after about 5 minutes of chewing it tastes like crap. It leaves a very nasty after taste in your mouth. I'm forcing myself to chew it so I don't feel like I've wasted my money but it's not worth it.  The Spry gum tastes soooooo much better and it lasts.  Also I've tasted the variety of Spry flavors and they are all good.  So my final recommendation is to save your money on this product if taste matters. If it doesn't matter and cleaning you teeth is the key issue then go right ahead and torture yourself.

As soon as we brought out her old litter, she used it right way. And this morning, she also tried to eat the pine pellets and then vomited! Not good.

B0042XEPRK,A201TMK1NHXYJ9,Elizabeth,7,8,1,2011-03-13,"BEWARE ""YEAST EXTRACT""","Although my cats rejected Merrick's Quail & Chicken, I'm giving it five stars [but not anymore - see UPDATE below] because I think it smells great and the ingredients list is excellent. After supplementing their regular canned food with small amounts of the Quail & Chicken over a period of about two weeks (six cans divided between two cats) in order to introduce it gradually, the cats began refusing to eat it all together. It smells like roasted poultry and they ate it readily at first. I feel it must not have agreed with their tummies, or they would have continued to eat it. But who knows why these things happen with fussy cats. I tried to reintroduce it several times over the next few weeks, but they'd have none of it.<br /><br />I haven't tried lots of different natural canned foods for my cats, but I have found two that they consistently like. Those are Natural Life Lamaderm Lamb & Rice Platter and Natural Balance Indoor Cat Formula. But who knows why they prefer those, or how long that preference will last.<br /><br />UPDATE (July 17, 2011): I've recently learned about an ingredient in Merrick's canned cat foods that may have caused my cats to reject it, after having eaten it readily at first. That ingredient is ""yeast extract."" It seems that this is just an innocent-sounding name for glutamates (the same as in monosodium glutamate or MSG). It's an appetite stimulant (flavor enhancer) with the same side effects as MSG. For the many who are sensitive to it, the side effects of glutamate include headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, heartburn, etc.<br /><br />If a cat eats something that tastes good, but then the cat feels sick, it will eventually reject that food. I'm glad they have that survival instinct or they'd be sick all the time thanks to these dumb pet food companies that will feed them anything. It would be a real coup to get pets addicted to your brand of pet food by adding a flavor enhancer that other brands didn't have, now wouldn't it? Of course, it if makes them sick and they reject it, then the scheme has backfired.<br /><br />And, by the way, my cats still enjoy the Natural Life and Natural Balance foods that I've been feeding them. So it seems it wasn't just a passing preference.<br /><br />Because of the deceptive ingredient ""yeast extract"" and its potential for making pets sick, I now give this food a ""1 star"" rating."

Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware."

Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation.

Well, apparently it can if it gets moldy.<br /><br />Now, I have eaten a lot of jerky in my life.  I've made jerky. Properly prepared, jerky should not get moldy. I have never, ever had turkey jerky get moldy in an unopened package. But we found mold on the next package we opened, and by the time we got to the next one, it was covered in mold. These were stored in a dark, cool, dry place. We ended up throwing away the rest.<br /><br />I am glad that neither my family nor I got food poisoning from this stuff. Do not buy!"

Neither listed citric acid, which can be a corn derivative, but it was listed on the box when I received it.  Corn is one of my daughter's allergens, so I could not feed her this product without knowing the source of the citric acid used.  I have tried calling the company for a week and keep being told an ingredients specialist will call me back, but they NEVER do.  I have written the company via the contact us form on the website, but no one will contact me to give me the information I need to know.  Fortunately, amazon.com was very helpful and issued me a refund, but Bremner cannot be trusted if you have food allergy questions.  I am very upset at the lack of concern from this company.

Also, they add ""other natural flavorings"" which I try to avoid because usually that's food-industry-speak for msg and stuff like that, which gives me headaches.  I understand that the company wants to make this drink more palatable to children and to reluctant health-nuts, but I think it's the wrong way to go to put more sugar than almonds in it, and the wrong way to go to add all kinds of ""flavoring"" when almonds are so beautifully flavored on their own.

So many cat foods on the market have grains as the main components, and so you have to look for products labeled ""grain free"".  We found some at our local feed store.  Maybe our first cat would have lived longer if we'd fed him better."

However once you open it you start to realize how not great it is.<br /><br />1.  The most weird thing about this basket is that they items have been repackaged.  There is a box of carmel corn the cover made it look like it was a fake version of the item.  When you open it up you are even more suspicious b/c the caramel corn is inside a wheat thins box! huh? many of the items are similarly repackaged this way.  I would never send someone a basket that is so obviously homemade instead of a legit company.<br /><br />2.  many of the items were so small.  Inside was a tiny box of jelly beans, a one serving of peanuts, cashews etc.  I am use to seeing in baskets a can of nuts not a single serving snack travel pack. Also some of the items were a little strange to me - German hot mustard in a green tube...it didn't seem to match the caramel corn, jelly beans, nuts and crackers.  There was a package of sausage but still...<br /><br />3.  never heard of the brands -- now this could just be me.  these may be very famous brands and people know them all over the world.  But with the suspect packaging I thought the food itself was also of a lower class.  After tasting the items such as the caramel corn - which was stale, Hit cookies which were blah an oreo is better, and the malt shop taffies not very tasty, my disappointment just grew.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.  you could build a better basket on your own or go with a well known company.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />after I wrote this review Black Mountian now ig4U sent me a new basket.  It was packaged so much better.  It didn't look scary fake like the first one did.  I appreciate the company's effort to make right something that was not good.  I think that a person would be ok sending out their new and improved baskets.  I still stick to my original post that I think the food items were boring and not names that people would know but they tasted fine this time.  I change my star rating to 3 stars."

I would love to support this product and feed it to my big fluffy girl... she's really not a kitty anymore, and she's usually not picky with her dry food. However, she hates this food and literally turns her nose up at it. I've tried fooling her by mixing it in with her other dry food... since I had to go out and buy a bag of her old stuff, that is. She's good at leaving this stuff in the bowl and sorting out the food she likes. So I am about to toss this food in the garbage, and I hate to waste food. I wonder if there are too many veggies in this food? Cats and dogs are carnivores after all. Carrots and oats and peas are not really good for them. I'm at my computer right now, away from the ingredients list, but I recall this food is heavy on the veggie, non-meat ingredients. Sadly, I will not be buying this great-sounding product again.

The strawberry/kiwi flavor is very muted and is masked by something terrible.  The taste was bad going down but worse after a minute or so, as the aftertaste is strong and unpleasant.<br /><br />On top of the bad taste and unpleasant aroma, the drink has a considerable amount of calories for a small can at 135 calories per 8.3 ounces.

($23.29)<br />-Coffee: Lavazza - Crema e Gusto 250g enough for 50 capsules ($5.75)<br />-Empty capsule weight: ~1 gram<br />-Filled capsule weight: ~6 grams<br />-One capsule preparation time: 60-70 secs<br />-Cost of filled capsule: ~$0.35<br /><br />The main reasons for purchasing the refill capsules are, being able to enjoy the coffee I like and save some money.<br /><br />I haven't encountered any troubles with the capsules EXCEPT that you dont get the best out of it, as most of the hot water is spilled into the used capsules container; although I had the capsules filled, pressed and sealed appropirately. Therefore, I had to reuse the same capsule, however, sometimes replaced it with another one. The reason of water spill/waste is that Ne-Cap capsules are shorter than Nespresso capsules. Thus I assume if they were the same size, the capsules will perform much better.<br /><br />This option is somehow economical, nevertheless, sometimes you may need to use two capsules to enjoy your Espresso, or Cappuccino cup.<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are not enjoying the taste of Nespresso flavours or you like to have your own ground coffee, and want to save some $$$, go for it..BUT dont expect the same performance and cleanness of Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />Update 2/8/2012================<br /><br />When I first used the Ne-Caps, I gave it 3 stars. After using almost 30 capsules, I got to believe that it's not worth it and that Nespresso capsules are irreplaceable. I tried all possible ways to enhance the performance of the capsules, I made more holes at the base, also I dilated the existing ones, but all my attempt were useless. The shape of Ne-Cap pods should be modified to look like nespresso ones. That way, I believe they would be better. So my advice is to stick to nespresso despite the price. Save yourself the time and headache and enjoy your easy, tasty coffee."

B0006L0UVM,A24098I8376NJJ,Erudite Musings,1,14,1,2011-04-30,Curiously awful,"Cola is by far my favorite drink.  My wife and I usually have a debate of Pepsi vs. Coke, me preferring Coke, and neither one of us will ever win.  So I saw this bottle and was very hopeful to find something which would stop the argument once and for all.<br /><br />Fentiman's cola comes in a nice looking bottle, it has an old fashioned feel to it, and even the name ""Curiosity"" beckons something forth from the early 1900s -- a certain naivit&eacute; if you will.<br /><br />When I first opened the bottle I found that it was not as heavily carbonated as say my favorite Coke or my wife's Pepsi, something which might prove a boon to the product.  I sniffed it, and it had a distinct smell of cheap no-brand colas (to which I have resorted in the past during periods of smaller wallets).  That's not to say it was bad, it just is what it is.  I took a sip of the liquid and managed to get out the words ""This really isn't too--"" before my face contorted in waves of disgust.  It was one of the foulest sodas I have tasted to date, and that includes the old Tab drink.  For the first couple of seconds it just tastes like a cheaper cola, but then the aftertaste hits you, and it is vile.<br /><br />I would get this for someone for a gag gift (emphasis on the word ""gag"" here), but I will never purchase another bottle for my own sake.<br /><br />Having spent money on the bottle, however, I did not wish to waste it, so I guzzled the whole thing (this is where the limited carbonation indeed became a boon for the product).  This did turn out, in the end, to be a mistake, as every time the carbonation would force a burp I'd get nothing of the ""not so bad"" taste from the first couple of seconds, but instead I got all the horrible aftertaste.<br /><br />This may be close to what Cola once was.  It is, however, important to remember that it has evolved for a few reasons, and taste is one of those reasons.  Give me a Coke any day, or even a Pepsi."

Being a huge fan of many of Ener-G products, I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit.  How wrong I was.  The Ener-G pizza crusts are too thin, dense, and heavy, with very little taste.  You would think ""thin"" and ""heavy"" would be contradictory, but that's what I really mean to say.  By contrast, the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy, with such an outstanding declicious flavor.  I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener-G pizza crusts from your local health food store first.  I made a mistake trusting Ener-G on this product before I bought a whole case of it.  It was an expensive lesson.

B002Z9EQQ8,A2ISKAWUPGGOLZ,M. S. Handley,2,4,1,2011-07-16,Kitty Junk Food,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."

I kept trying it thinking I would like it or I did something wrong, but it tasted nasty every time.<br /><br />Having said that, I think it's worthy to note that SodaStream makes a variety of flavors, some of which are unique and delicious. In addition, I have made some drinks with this base by mixing in some tastier flavors.<br /><br />As another review stated, SodaStream does NOT save money. But it is pretty fun."

B002PMCGEE,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,Ian,4,10,1,2011-02-16,Hope you like it burnt,"The friendly face of Mr. Redenbacher may grace this bag of popcorn, and the bright colors and promising text may promise a healthy snack in every bag, but don't be fooled.  Behind that kind smile and bright colors is the smell of smoke, and blackened dreams.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the worst popcorn I've ever had.  Not for it's taste, but in the fact that every single time I've microwaved it, both the popcorn and the bag itself come out burnt.  No matter how closely I followed the directions, or turned down the power setting, or changed the times, both the bag and the corn came out blackened, filling the kitchen with the pungent odor of burnt popcorn.<br /><br />For those who think the problem may lie with the microwave I used, that wasn't the case, as it is new (only a month old).  While I initially went on a setting of 10 (high), like the bag recommends, I eventually resorted to going as low as 7, which resulted in the bag going flat, and the bottom getting burned.  At that point, my father and I agreed that I had wasted my money.  I've popped bags of popcorn over 5 years old that tasted better and come out with no burn marks whatsoever.<br /><br />Despite the low calorie count per bag, this is one popcorn best left on the shelf."

Word of warning this isn't the first Gluten Free product that this has happened to me on. It boiled up into a pot of paste suitable for making paper mache and not suitable for eating. I have tried using bigger pots with more water and still no luck. Also the cooking time is way off, no matter how long you cook the pasta it just dissolves. The pasta never reaches a stage of being done. This is one of over a dozen GF pastas that I have used and the only one that I have had a problem with.

I have not had any of the other brands do that so I know it had to be the coffee.  I am guessing that the coffee was ground to fine for a K-Cup.  I only have 8 more left and will be glad.

But the taste... oh man, the taste. It tasted like pure vinegar. The sauce was SO SOUR. The acidity overpowered any soy or sesame flavor by a long shot. The only thing I can think is that in order to compensate for the dish being lower sodium than most noodle bowl type things, they tried to ramp up the flavor with acidic ingredients. A touch of acidity does help bring out the flavor when you reduce the salt, but this was WAY too much."

They were hard, white on the outside and many were cracking. And I might have been okay with them being a little stale, but they were gross.  I had read the other reviews that said the same, but thought maybe that had just been a bad batch at some point a long time ago. My order in December 2011 was definitely not within the freshness date. I looked all over the package to try to find a manufacture date or ""fresh by"" date and there wasn't one, which is likely part of the problem, if the packages were dated, the shipper would be able to verify they weren't sending out old food. I would order somewhere else. As much as I pay for safe treats that my kids can have it's worth it paying a little more for a fresh product."

Not willing to write off the reviews I had read that easily, I thoroughly cleaned the French press -again- and tried the coffee. Same taste.

After emailing the company inquiring into my order, I was informed that they would now ship my product - 3 weeks after the order date!  Upon arrival of the purchase, I noticed a misshapen box on my doorstep.  Upon opening the box, I discovered my Fruit Snacks box was misshapen and squished, because it was placed in a shipping box that was smaller than the fruit snacks box, totally ruining the shape and appearance of the Fruit Snacks box.  In addition, under the fruit snacks box was a crumpled packing slip, which included a coupon for 5% off my next purchase from this company.  It's too bad the coupon expired 3 days before I even received the fruit snacks box, since the coupon was printed three weeks prior, when I actually ordered the thing.<br /><br />Tl;dr DO NOT purchase stuff from this company.  It is worth the extra time needed to find another supplier or buying it from the store.  I paid more for this product than it's price at costco citing convenience due to not having to leave my home, and ended up experiencing the worst online purchase in my 10 years of purchasing history."

For peace of mind buy certified organic as farmers pay attention to detail, don't share equipment or bins, and are monitored strictly so they are paid a higher prices per pound. There's a difference in what kind of fertilizer is used on the land. Our organic seeds come from certified organic land which uses alfalfa as fertilizer, while our pesticide-free seed farmers have the option of using a synthetic topical on the soil, very much the same as liquid plant food you can buy for your house. This synthetic topical is man-made and not organic, which is why our Pesticide-Free product line cannot be certified organic.<br /><br />Also the tubs are gigantic which makes storing a pain. I've gotten a couple of tubs that needed to be cut open because it wasn't perforated and they couldn't be resealed which also was a problem because the product couldn't stay fresh. They need to stick with the resealable bags and jars rather than these tubs. Cheap is not always worth it that's for sure. I'll stick to true organic in bags that take up little space."

B001U2HRLM,A1Q3C8EFFVBWU,Charlotte H,1,2,1,2012-01-02,Revised review,"My original review was full of praise of this formula, it's still down below this one. However, I have to give the company and their formula 1 star after the events of the past week. On Feb 16th their two main formula brands, dairy and soy, both tested very high for arsenic (organic and inorganic versions). The company promised to conduct their own testing and come back with their findings. Today they got their results back from their third party laboratory, but refuse to share the findings from said laboratory. They claim that their formula upholds to the FDA regulations, but since there are no FDA regulations for arsenic in food, that really doesn't hold any merit. I really wished and hoped that the company would come back and discredit the arsenic-study, however, this in my eyes just proved that the study was correct. I am currently on the lookout for another brand of formula for my baby.<br /><br />This is my original review:<br /><br />Our daughter has been really fussy and slept really poorly when we fed her a major brand formula. We tried said major brands formula for gassy and fussiness, but she refused to drink it. Then we got this formula at a national chain healthy food store. She loves the stuff. It smells and tastes much nicer than other formulas (yes, I have tasted formula) and resembled my breastmilk better than other formulas. I wish we had known about this formula when I needed to supplement her, because she would refuse to drink other formula if she was receiving breastmilk and I think she would gladly have drank this one.<br /><br />Anyway, after 4 days on this formula, she would sleep through the night and not wake up grumping and groaning at night. We couldn't afford more cans right now, so we went back to the major brand formula yesterday, and last night she woke up 5-6 times complaining as well as waking up for a night time feed."

I received this early this morning and used it before I bathed  This product has given me a problem. There were no instructions for usage so I used this as a pre-treatment. I dampened my hair and applied two quarter sized globs on my hair. I massaged it lightly on the scalp and then combed it through my shoulder length hair. I put a plastic shower cap on and gave it a half hour to absorb. Right now my hair is pretty dry as well as over exposed to sun and salt water. My hair is also straight and extremely fine.<br />I showered and washed my hair. It felt smooth and soft in the shower, however as it started air drying I realized that my hair was seriously greasy. I ended washing it with a clarifying shampoo three times in total to get rid of the greasy consistency. Frankly, I thought I might have to use Dawn (my perennial degreaser) or Tide to get my hair clean. My hair is still over moisturized but presentable at least.<br />I can't recommend this product based on my experience using it.  It is quite possible that it might work better on coarser hair, but it doesn't do it for fine straight hair. I also think it would help if the manufacturer provided instructions for usage."

I buy mine in the pack of three saves a bit and I use them quickly , However if you really enjoy Mina and are 5 star happy with it great !! I am happy for you.<br />But I can say this with complete honesty once you have tried Mustaphas I doubt you will ever want to buy any other . So How do I describe how wonderful a product Mustaphas Moccican Harissa is ?and how the two compare ( they are so different )<br />Mina is thin weak almost tasting like it came from a can .<br />Mustaphas is thick almost as thick as tomato paste with a beautiful deep rich flavor and color which is beautiful, the heat is wonderful, ( you must be able to enjoy the heat) but it is not just raw heat, it is flavor a depth of flavor that almost allows you to picture Mustaphas being made in small homemade batches by artisans who know the taste they are crafting  the flavor will transport you ( no magic carpet required ) and you will find so many uses for it .again the flavor is rich sumptuous the level of heat can be adjusted by the amount you use it takes very little to enjoy the rich flavor and it melds with everything but it is hot .<br />I could not find anything that I could use Mina on, I tried, it was 9.00 for the jar and I felt I must try top like it but in the end I yet threw away a nearly full jar of Mina in a household where even the youngest grandchildren love hot sauces and Harissa ( in small amounts )<br />no one at all liked the Mina product !! My fridge has many bottles of hot sauces, We go through so many, a big favorite is Marie Sharps one of the most flavorful hot sauces We have ever had discovered it years ago when in Belize. I say this so that I might offer you a reference point of my personal taste .I do not mean to compare them as similar products, both are quite different except for astounding flavor, uniqueness, and quality .I hope that this review helps ( and that you will forgive the gramatical errors ).Please check out Mustaphas available on the Amazon site the jar does not show the name in a pronounced way the print that shows the name of the brand is small the words Morrican Harissa might help identify or just do a search . but look for it, try it, do not judge Harissa by Mina !! there can be no comparison between the two .If you are happy with Mina so be it .but if it is the only one you have tried then try Mustaphas take a chance, just be ready to buy a lot of it since you will find so many uses for it, and you will miss it when you run out to be sure .Thanks for listening to sum it up ,I do not like the Mina product at all !! I will not belittle it anymore than I have .I would rather offer you positives and Mustaphas is that positive to be sure .Thanks again"

Terrible!!<br /><br />**UPDATE** 11-OCT-2011  - I tossed all the stale Paragon corn last week in the trash, decided it wasn't worth dealing with if it was moldy, stale, and wouldn't completly pop.

The wrapper on one of the bars was torn and i had to bin it. I didn't make a big deal over one bar even though i paid around $6 for the box of 5. I bought it again hoping there would be no torn wrappers, but there were two, which left me with only 3 bars (the ones in torn packages were rock solid, not that i would eat unwrapped bars anyway)! The third and the last time i bought this product 4 bars had wrappers with tiny wholes in them, they weren't hermetically sealed and were stale, tough, and inedible. Only one bar was properly hermetically sealed and contained a bit of air in the wrapper.<br />I thought that purchasing defective product three times was a bit too much (for $18 spent on 3 packages i only got 8 bars which i actually could eat as opposed to 15 which i paid for). I phoned the company and told them what happened. They refused to issue the refund and they didn't seem to care about the defects at all.

I didn't think much about it until today, when I decided to saw one in half so that my dog could have a quick chewy treat. The outside the roll looked perfect -- they appear to be densely rolled rawhides. But, upon looking inside the roll I discovered that THE ROLL WAS A HOLLOW TUBE!<br /><br />These rolls are very deceptive. You could give hundreds of these to your dogs and not realize that there is very little rawhide in them.<br /><br />Whoever rolled the hides simply rolled an external hide once around two thin strips of rawhides into the end of the rolls to make them look like a long length of hide had been rolled up tight (imagine a thin coil of rawhide neatly stuffed into each end of the roll). To make matters worse, there seems to be some kind of spray foam used as an adhesive to keep it all together.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find a high quality US rawhide company that ships to your local pet store."

B004SRH2B6,A1WX42M589VAMQ,Mir,110,124,1,2010-05-17,Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!,"Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes ""just like"" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is ""natural"" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to ""optimize"" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's ""optimized"" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to ""optimize."" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under ""Todd O'Connor"". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by ""Todd O'Connor"" and under Alio ""Alio""s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio ""Alio"" confirming the fake identity.)"

The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks!

B002Z9EQQ8,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,7,11,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever.

B00141OU50,A2V5M9PJB971I2,S. Brauer,80,83,1,2009-10-16,BEWARE:  MADE IN CHINA,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]"

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

So I thought it was fair to give another point of view.  I love popcorn more than any other food.  This is possibly the worst popcorn I have ever had.<br /><br />Normally, I use canola or peanut oil, fresh locally grown corn, & sea salt.  It is absolutely delicious with very few hulls or unpopped kernels.  It is much better (& better for you) than microwave or any other popping method using oil.<br /><br />This stuff was stale, & had way too much sodium.  The coconut oil mixture was disgusting. The taste was so bad that I threw the rest of it away after a few handfuls.  I had split the original batch in half, & gave 1/2 to my neighbor, who usually will eat anything.  Even she thought it was poor quality.  Now I'm stuck with 2 boxes of this junk.<br /><br />I gave it 1 star because every kernel did pop, and the cooking time was quick.

First off this is pricey food, so I expect it to live up to what it claims. I started mixing this in with my cat's old food (25/75), and he barely ate from the bowl, and tried to pick around it. When he did eat it, he threw it up after. He has NEVER thrown up food, and rarely gets hairballs, so something is really wrong when he throws up 3 times in 2 days. And to top it off, I weighed him before I started the food and after, and he GAINED weight! Thankfully I bought it at Petco, where you can bring back any food for a full refund."

Like other reviewer mentioned any kind of onion product is really bad for dogs, also sugar, salt, BHA.

First af all, I have fed this Duck and Potato dry food to my dog for 4 years and never had a single issue, in fact she was a heathly vibrant dog with great vitality during that period. I bought 4 large bags about 5 months ago, because I like to keep a nice supply on hand. After I fed her from a freshly opened bag, I was greeted with a bloody diarrhea crime scene all over the house at 3:00 in the morning. Actually, it was more blood than stool and I freaked out not knowing what was going on, she was then shaking uncontrollably in discomfort. I took her to the vet and $200 later after all the tests, we found nothing. I put her on a strict chicken and rice formula for a month and she was just fine, so I decided to start feeding her the same Natural Balance again, not knowing it was the food doing it and the same nightmare happened again(bloody mucusy stool). Another month of Chicken and rice and no problems. Well, tonight I mixed in literally 15 small pieces of that Duck and Potato with a bunch of rice and chicken and I can already hear her stomach gurgling like it did before. I promply gave her an anti-diarrheal just to be safe, but i'm watching her close and it'll probably be another sleepless night of cleaning up a disaster zone.<br /><br />I just finished reading other reviews tonight on the net about other people having similar problems and it's all because this company changed their formula. I think the ""new"" formula is worse than that tainted malamine food that got in the supply a few years ago. My pet store won't return the bags I have, because I never thought about keeping the receipts from a product I've used for soo many years without problems, now I have to eat another $200 and toss this junk on the garbage. I won't even consider giving it to my neighbors dog, because I'm not the sadistic type.<br /><br />This product should be recalled and it's not healthy for any dog. Even if it seems the dog might not be showing bad symptoms, it can't possibly be good considering what my dog has gone through. Shame on you Mr Patten for cutting corners and you better come out with a formal apology for this mishap. I am using several types of your canned food at the moment(except the duck and potato canned food) and the are no problems this those(yet), but rest assured I've lost faith with the reputation of your company and will move on to other healthier avenues for my dogs dietary needs."

B000X1Q1G8,A3GA7VBD1PJJKU,ceastama,1,1,1,2012-07-21,The Buddha calls it dukkha,"As I am writing this, this listing has 130 (out of 173) 1-star reviews (soon to be 131). Please bear in mind that I rarely review products; I must feel very strongly about one before I review it.<br /><br />I am an adventurous person, and when it comes to food, as long is it is vegetarian I will try anything. Even if the experience is terrible I do not regret chancing it; this is how you find GOOD foods (also bad). But IMHO this product is not good and it is probably not food. Judging by the ingredients, it appears to be mainly water, vegetable fiber (probably the bulk of its volume), and peanut flavoring/extract. I lean toward health foods and like others, have portion control issues when it comes to legit pb, one of my famous weaknesses. I was intrigued when I found this in our local wal mart; calorie-free imitation peanut butter! With low expectations I opted to give it a fair chance BEFORE reading a single review.<br /><br />I mistakenly applied this product single-agent to a sandwich. I have not yet managed to consume this in its entirety; it was a failed experiment. I will hold off on throwing this out until I have mustered up the courage to attempt it in a different setting. It has a few positive reviews, so I suspect that it may be redeemable somehow (I may take up some reviewers' suggestions) but thus far I believe this product to be a travesty; this is coming from a person who can tolerate certain well-known brands of veggie bacon.<br /><br />Okay, I knew this product would be so different from actual pb that it would be unfair to compare it. I did not expect it to resemble pb, however I did expect it to resemble food at least in some remote fashion. The texture is that of a synthetic, waxy, fluffy butter (why is it ""whipped""???). The taste is.. somewhat akin to the same, but I would not recommend it as a butter substitute except in non-food usages which I may attempt, as I hate to be wasteful. I would compare the taste to what I would expect of a spread made from crayons. Brown crayons, ew.<br /><br />So here's my 100% honest and dead-serious evaluation: truly, you and I are better off looking to natural sources with awesome flavor and more balanced nutrition to go with the calories. We could probably do with a little less artifice all around, and this product has no nutritional value whatsoever-- except some sodium. It even lacks dietary fiber, despite vegetable fiber being the second ingredient listed (after water)! If you are trying to eat healthier, this is surely not the way. If you are on a low-calorie diet, learn portion control-- and I empathize with the pain you feel in even considering cutting down on our beloved peanut butter. As for myself, I have to get my protein from somewhere and pb is my main squeeze, so in my pantry the Walden Farms was never destined to be more than a novelty to begin with.<br /><br />The one good thing that came of this experience, besides satisfying my curiosity? A number of the 1-star reviews praised certain other Walden Farms products DESPITE this unforgettable failure. I consider this a brave endorsement as I would personally be embarrassed to defend the entities that brought this abomination into our world. So brave, in fact, that I am convinced of their authenticity (unless ALL of these individuals are trolling), and will be looking forward to sampling OTHER Walden Farms products (this was my first). But, as for redeeming this one, I am not hopeful.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />- I DO NOT recommend this product in any way.<br /><br />- I CANNOT recommend any alternative low-cal pb substitutes as I have not personally sampled any others.<br /><br />+ I DO recommend MaraNatha for a more natural and flavorful nut butter experience. With some self-control it is worth the calories and the price.<br /><br />+ I HIGHLY recommend, in addition to the above, diet and exercise. If you can't cut portions, walk it off."
B003TRL58M,A4045YX5BYL7S,Amber,1,1,1,2011-12-24,Waste of Money!,"We bought this kit because we thought it would be cute.  I never buy a kit without assuming the pieces will be cheap, but this surpassed my imagination.  Their ""decorating bags"" are cheap plastic bags, even though they give you professional tips (you can't screw a tip onto a plastic bag).  The result is a mess- frosting leaking from around the tip, and the seams on the bag break.  Even if it hadn't leaked, I don't think there would have been enough frosting to do the whole barn, but I lost a lot of it due to leakage.  From there, the gingerbread was too soft to hold up- the roof pieces buckled and the walls cracked.  Normally a gingerbread piece has trouble holding together due to the frosting- in this case, it was the gingerbread.<br /><br />Then, my family decided to call it a loss and just eat the mess we'd made.  Only we couldn't do that either.  The frosting was gross- not sweet, but very sticky, and the gingerbread was flavorless.  We threw the whole thing out.  I have permanently red-stained hands from the frosting leaking everywhere, so I look like I slaughtered an animal, and I have no gingerbread.  Very upsetting.  I'll never buy a kit again."

We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs."

I intended on using this organic formulation with my third, until I did more research. Similac chooses to use cheaper quality ingredients i.e cane sugar instead of lactose in this formula. It's the ""cheap"" way of making infant milk, although the product isn't cheap. Babies love it because it's loaded with extra, actual sugar instead of milk lactose similar to what is in breastmilk. Sadly, this formula is one of those scams by companies trying to get a piece of the green hype. Check out other brands instead. Earth's Best offers a better organic option for your child."

Unfortunately the store didn't carry this variety, so I opted for this type. I was SO disappointed. I put it in the microwave covered in cold skim milk for about a minute, and when I took it out, it was MUSH! I can still eat Quaker Oats when they're mushy, but this just had an awful taste. Even though the cooking instructions said to cook them longer, even the 1 minute made them sooo mushy! I for one love the chewy bite of steel cut oats, and am able to achieve a close enough mouth-feel with Quaker 5 minute oats (I microwave the oats with half water/half skim milk for about 2 minutes). I advise fellow steel-cut oat lovers to stay away from this one! Trust me! I eat oatmeal everyday for breakfast, and sometimes before my workout in the evening, and as a bedtime snack at night.... so needless to say, I know my oats! Lol<br /><br />Verdict: Go for the 5 minute Steel Cut oats by McCanns - its AMAZING... Steer cleer of this quick cooking variety, and opt for Quaker 5 minute Oats instead!"

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."

B002QWP89S,A22JW7FCT9ASWE,Allie,24,47,1,2009-09-19,Be careful with wheat gluten,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error."

I've emailed the company several times from their lousy website to see if this is normal or if my batch is contaminated, and after a month there has been no response. All 4 bottles, including the unopened ones, have this floating stuff in it. That can't be normal! So to summarize, doesn't taste like water, certainly doesn't taste ""like nothing"" -- tastes bad.

B003ANFMY8,A3B2IP2Q0CUBI6,azcatlover,5,7,1,2011-06-19,Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard,"I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real."

Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: ""includes mutant organisms"" and ""recombinant organisms"", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is ""extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.""<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: ""genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid"" and ""extraction with solvents such as ... hexane."" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health."

The original Propel Kiwi-Strawberry powder was, to me, the best tasting water additive on the planet!  Finally, I was able to drink quarts of water without forcing myself to do so.  The powder dissolved easily in my 16 ounce water bottle and the flavor was just sweet enough.  I have a sweet tooth and this stuff was awesome!  But some dumb focus group participants decided that ten calories per packet were just too many calories to allow in their diets each day. Ten bottles adds up to only 100 calories! Really?  Did they only ask anorexics?  The new version clumps in my water and has a bitter after taste.  I have to add my own artificial sweetener to get it to taste like the old version. That's way too much trouble for something that's supposed to be easy.  I even called Gatorade and begged them to bring back the other version along with the new but they said they wouldn't do it.  I am now looking for a replacement to Propel powder.  Mio Berry Pomegranate is real close and you can add as much or as little as you like.  I still mourn the passing of the original Propel powder but what can I do?  Marketing people are idiots and always will be."

It's so small that it's almost inert, it does nothing to stave off hunger or bring back alertness.

Of course the web site has a different label and advertises green peppercorns in brine which is what I was seeking.  Don't know if this is a onetime event due to an inventory mistake or what but just keep in mind that Amazon's policy is NO RETURNS ON FOOD ITEMS (including wrongly shipped food items).  I had to do a work around with the Amazon Returns online process (used a different refundable item to get a chat line open) and did manage a refund.  That's the good news.  The bad news is it took a lot more time than it should have to resolve an Amazon error.  If Amazon doesn't fix this issue (i.e., refunding ALL incorrectly shipped items that cannot be returned), I suggest not fooling around and just disputing charges directly with your credit card company and let Amazon sort it out on their time."

This product contains corn maltodextrin (which I have an allergy to), vegetable glycerin, and Indian sarsaparilla root. This is probably where the odd and nasty taste I am getting is coming from.<br /><br />And why the hell are these in coffee? Shouldn't it be JUST coffee and whatever flavoring is added?<br /><br />Way to go Starbucks! 1 star!<br />--- EDIT ---<br /><br />I've tried many different Starbucks coffees, from morning blends to more flavored coffees and not one have I enjoyed or liked.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor in Starbucks Natural Fusions is a joke. When you first open the bag you are hit with this amazing aroma of nice fragrant coffee with a delightful hint of vanilla. When brewing, you completely loose the vanilla smell. And once tasted, the vanilla is GONE. And I don't think I should be expected to have to add something (be it milk, cream, or some other product) to bring out the flavor of the coffee. A good coffee can stand alone straight from the pot.<br /><br />No matter how weak or strong I made it, it had a not so pleasant taste to it. I'm thinking that it had a lot of quakers in it before the coffee was ground, thus this odd taste was present.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality is the look and design of the bag, initial smell, and the fact that it gives me my caffeine for the day, even if I have to chug it.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board Starbucks and come back with a better tasting blend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Smells great!<br />Didn't get a bitter taste from it (oddly enough).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Didn't taste like vanilla by any stretch.<br />Isn't all that palatable to my or three other peoples taste.<br />Pricey for mediocre coffee."

Meaning, I want the experience to be motivating and rewarding. After testing this product on all three of my dogs, I think this stuff is too organic and wholesome for me and my pooches.<br /><br />CONS - When I opened the bag, I noticed these organic treats were very hard. I couldn't break them up with my hand to give in little pieces or use for training. I had to give the treat as a whole biscuit. Also they were very fibrous looking. Much like those unappealing high-fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths/gums of my smaller dogs.<br /><br />PROS - If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.<br /><br />Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats. My Cocker Spaniel, who usually begs me for everything and is highly food motivated, took a sniff and and a lick but ultimately was not interested in these wholesome treats. As for my little Pomeranian, well it was too hard and big of a biscuit for him.<br /><br />Even thought these treats are supposed to be nutritious and healthy, I only gave them 1 star because my dogs and I didn't enjoy them."

I didn't have to cut the bag open with a scissors as you do with some brands. There was no cellophane tape holding the flap down as you see in some brands. Since safety seals became standard on food and health and beauty products after the Tylenol scare, I have never received a food item from any manufacturer that provided no form of sealant to ensure that the product can't be tampered with after packaging.

After all, a number of Taco Bell restaurant menu offerings are quite good, even if not necessarily exceptional.<br /><br />Alas, I was disappointed; sorely disappointed, in fact. Let's start with nutritional information. A two tablespoon serving--- a fairly large serving, actually--- is 110 calories. That's quite a bit, but a smaller serving could control this. The issue is that of these 110 calories, a whopping 100 of them are from fat. That's hardly a healthy makeup.<br /><br />What about flavor? The sauce was creamy in consistency, but it was not creamy in taste; for that matter, neither was it bold or spicy. Our daughter described it as ""taco seasoning mixed with lard."" That is perhaps a bit harsh as there is no lard in the product, but nevertheless the sauce does have a fatty mouth feel and very little flavor. We tried it on a mixed salad (with onions, etc., to ensure that it would not be over-powered); we also tried it on tortilla chips and cooked ground beef. The results were all the same. There was little flavor and the sauce made the food taste and feel fatty.<br /><br />Though I wanted to like the sauce, I have to say that based on our experience with it, I definitely can't recommend it. It is unhealthy and lacking in flavor, and generally detracts from the food it was intended to enhance.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I really have to point out that the review sample I received was a few days beyond the ""best used by"" date. Although this wasn't exactly clever marketing to send your expired stock to your reviewers, I doubt if the product had deteriorated much if at all. Still, I mention this because it could have conceivably had an effect, and if you choose to buy the product, by all means be sure you have fresh stock."

You'd better be careful too since baby won't taste it and you may not find it before it's really bad! I feel so sorry for my baby since I know it's really bad to her health, much worse then giving her non-organic cereal. I won't ever buy the product again no matter how my baby likes it.

The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled candy bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56"">Quest Bar 2.12 oz.

I LOVE dark chocolate and I LOVE coconut, so I thought these were going to be pretty much the best thing ever.  As soon as I got them home, I opened one to try it.  I was sadly disappointed in both the chocolate and coconut taste of this bar.  The so-called ""dark chocolate"" is a paste-like frosting that, being chocolate, obviously should taste good, but has a weird texture that makes it gross.  I was thinking it was going to be like a layer of actual chocolate, similar to the layer of chocolate on the bottom of Kashi's Go-Lean Crunch bars (which are totally yummy), not chocolate flavored frosting on the top of the granola bar.  Second, these do NOT taste like coconut at all.  There is a sprinkling of dried coconut on the top of the nasty frosting, but you can't even taste it, mostly because the chocolate-y taste of the paste, uh, I mean frosting overwhelms it.  My kids won't even eat them and they will eat anything with frosting on it.  Actually, I guess now I have to say they will eat ALMOST anything with frosting on it.  I would skip these in favor of ANY OTHER Kashi granola bar.

I regard it as unhealthy because it is too high in saturated fat and too low in monounsaturated fat.

However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere.

Most recently, Timothy's Espresso, which I found it to be thin - and almost undrinkable (after my experience with Jet Fuel).<br /><br />I just order Black Tiger - but not in yet - so no comparison.<br /><br />Also, I often drink Newman's (my wife picks up at Sam's Club).

Since they were not to be shipped for several weeks, I assumed (yes I know) that shipping during August would be taken into consideration by the seller.  It wasn't.  While there was a little cushioning material around the box, there was no insulation at all and no markings on the outside of the box that it should be protected from heat.  Since the Mozart Balls are loose in the box, they melted into a variety of non-spheriodal shapes and the box itself was saturated with cocoa butter that was originally part of the candy.  Removing the foil is akin to untying badly knotted string that has been soaked in water and then dried.  The taste reminds me of Moon Pies.  Maybe in the winter months these are worth while, but I will stick to Reber in the future (each ball in an individual compartment and shipped with cooling packs in the summer).

It looks like a thick patty.  It is dense and chewy.  I bought the double chocolate chunk flavor.  It has a mild cocoa flavor with notes of prune and bitter coffee. It is only slightly sweet, and has a hint of medicinal quality.  Though listed in the ingredients, I could not find a single chocolate chunk that was large enough to differentiate from the rest of the heavy, soft patty.  Most of the doughy thing is chewable but there are small grains of something that are distinctly harder and got caught in the cusps of my molars.<br /><br />If you are too busy to enjoy your food or can't taste anything anyway, maybe these are for you.  For me, when I spend 300 calories, even on the run, I want something that makes my mouth happy.  Half a whole wheat English muffin, a tablespoon of natural peanut butter, half a banana sliced on top.  All around better! And no messier to eat because these patties are crumbly and a slightly sticky.  You'll have bits on your upholstry and traces on the steering wheel.<br /><br />Reformulate, Erin!

B0002MLA5K,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,18,24,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Just for laughs, I went to the website and it says if you use a coffee filter it will filter out the barley.  What a bunch of BS.  I tried it the first time and I felt like I got kicked in the gut really hard when I was at my last sip, but I felt better about 2 hours later and I wasn't AS SICK as I normally get when I have gluten.

This isn't one of those cases though.<br /><br />First, the taste of the dressing is very tart. We're not talking mild 'dress up'. Somebody at the product production factory got a little too carried away with the recipie creation. So even people really liking blue cheese flavor (such as myself) are going to grimace when eating this stuff. Pouring it down the kitchen sink might be a better option.<br /><br />Then, detecting cheese flavors themselves become hard when there are little to none cheese chunks actually appearing in the product. It was questionable practice back in another era, but today definently, merely having a tart salad dressing should not count as having produced a blue cheese salad dressing.<br /><br />When other shelf dressings have actually now mastered putting detectable cheese chunks into their dressing, Wishbone would be wise to copy their playbook and upgrade the quality of it's recipie."

B001VIY8BW,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,2,4,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Consider me sold!<br /><br />However, I must have missed that single line of the description that says ""contains peppermint leaves"" because I sure was surprised when my delicious fruit tea came out tasting like a candy cane (and a bad one at that). The mint overpowers every other flavor, but the addition of fruit undercuts the peppermint, so it's not really a mint tea OR a fruit tea. It's mostly just a ""bleh"".<br /><br />So awful I couldn't even give it away. Most people just smelled it and went ""no thanks""...can't say I blame them!<br /><br />That said, Tea Forte has some good teas. This just isn't one of them."

By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food.

It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see ""made in USA"" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was ""sorry I was out of town"".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.

I then tried it in a tiny 6 oz tea cup and it still really had no flavor other then a slight taste of cinnamon in hot water. Very weak tea with awful side effects of extreme nausea. Not sure if this was from the acid in it or something else, maybe the cinnamon. I can't recommend this on any level, it is weak and tasteless with awful side effects at least for me.

The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.<br /><br />So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...<br /><br />I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...<br /><br />This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly.

My fiancee sent me to the store with ""advice"" to pick up a bottle of Dove unscented bodywash.<br /><br />Turns out Dove unscented, isn't; at least, not exactly.<br /><br />We found that out the next morning as I was getting ready. Despite the ""unscented"" label, while using the bodywash in the shower, the stuff has a very heavy fragrance, not really any different in strength than my usual Denali. So...Wasn't too surprised to get out of the shower only to find my fiancee on the other side of the apartment and every single balcony door open.<br /><br />That being said, the scent did seem to dissipate quickly and left only a faint odor after 15 minutes and no detectable scent within 30, but still.<br /><br />After a call to Unilever, customer service told me what April discovered. Namely, that the unscented bodywash did contain a fragrance (malfa or malta or something like that), but it was intended only to mask/neutralize the natural odors of the ingredients and definitely shouldn't have come across as a ""heavy"" odor in use, so...<br /><br />I don't know if we just wound up with a bad bottle or if that's just how the stuff works/smells, but. It obviously wouldn't work for our needs, so I'm back to basics with a plain, unscented bar of soap."

I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet.

B000QSN7P6,A3B2IP2Q0CUBI6,azcatlover,5,7,1,2011-06-19,Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard,"I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real."
B002AK88SY,A33ZYFE8XMKKR1,"P. Scott Pope ""Scott Pope""",31,36,1,2012-07-15,What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables.

B000SATIFA,A1D4NX1651R170,Eugene Dimarsky,29,29,1,2011-08-25,This isn't gunpowder green tea,"I like tea, in fact I like it a lot. I've had some good gunpowder green tea in the past from adagio as well as Twinnings and it is a beautiful thing. You put what look like little BBs of green tea into your cup or teapot, add the water, and you can see the tea practically explode into nearly full size leaves of tea (hence the name).<br /><br />Davidson's tea disappoints. The tea leaves really don't expand much which tells me they weren't really rolled the way gunpowder green tea is supposed to be. This tea also lacks flavor (at least compared to the other gunpowder green teas I've tried). I used the same amount to brew the same cup of tea I've been enjoying with Twinnigs and frankly the Davidson's version tasted more like hot water than green tea. This may be because the leaves aren't as compacted as a proper gunpowder green tea so the same tablespoon of tea now has less actual mass of tea leaves, it could be because this tea has a lower quality tea leaf in it, heck it could be because this is an old batch of tea for all I know.<br /><br />The point of this review is to say that this tea was a complete waste of money. I am sorry to say I paid for an entire pound of it. I will try it once or twice more, but if the results remain the same I will likely have to throw out the rest of the bag and that would just make me sad because it would mean that I've wasted both money and tea.<br /><br />I have added a photo of the actual tea I received (compare it to that in the original product photos and you'll see a huge difference). Mine is the one that does not look like it is magically hanging in the air and defying gravity.<br /><br />TL;DR version: Don't buy this tea. It isn't really gunpowder green tea and is not worth your money."

This sauce isn't even the right color. I made up their recipe (which was more or less right except it added the peanuts at the wrong point) and I got a brown mess (should have been more reddish in color) that tasted vaguely sour--only because I added lime juice. It was as flavorless as milk and water. The same is true of their red or green curry paste. Totally taste-free.<br /><br />I suppose they mixed up new recipes to suit ""American"" tastes and the mixtures that passed a broad taste panel had no taste; not everyone likes Thai food. But this Pad Thai mix is absolutely garbage.<br /><br />Go find a recipe--it's not that hard to make and skip this sauce. It's bad.

They use no onion or garlic in any of their products. Most companies do list ""spices"" but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately.

It was quick, easy and awesome.  This is nothing but a bag of powder that is hard to reconstitute with mayo and sour cream.  Then you have to add your own artichokes and cheese. What's the point of a mix if you have to provide virtually everything.  The flavor is very artificial and for some reason still tastes like powder hours later.  Yuck.  What a disappointment."

Okay, not all vegan stuff is great, but a lot is pretty tasty.  This stuff is horrid.  I can't begin to tell you what they taste like -- sickly sweet paste with sawdust and a bit of strawberry flavor might come close.  The word ""super food"" is a lie -- I hated the bar immediately, regardless of how good it was supposed to be for me.  I handed a piece to my husband who likes twigs and granola and he made a face.  One of my dogs took a sniff and walked away.  I convinced her to take a piece and she set it down and sort of ate it --  and then looked at me like I had played some cruel joke.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with 11 bars to foist off on people I hate.

B007I7YZJK,A70NFM6KHU24F,Trevor Burnham,4,7,1,2012-05-18,Don't be fooled,"There's a stark disconnect between the front of the product's packaging (which promises ""Iced Green Tea"" with honey and natural fruit flavors) and the actual product. Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they're drinking.<br /><br />The result is a product that's almost indistinguishable from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DHE"">Sugar Free Kool-Aid</a>, but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it's got ""no aspartame""--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this ""tea mix,"" a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.<br /><br />Now, it's one thing to emphasize a product's naturalness (""natural flavors,"" ""made with real ingredients,"" ""tea & honey,"" ""real fruit flavors"") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there's one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: ""sweetened with honey."" Let's examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as ""Honey granules (sugar, honey),"" which means that there's actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there's as much honey as pure sugar, there's only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).<br /><br />So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton."

B008BLFJXI,A2NEPYTTU9P0OU,skykid14,5,11,1,2011-12-06,ALERT!! - CONTAINS CHEMICAL SWEETENER,"BEWARE - This cereal contains a chemical sweetener called Aspartame (aka Sweet'nLow), which is a dangerous chemical food additive shown to cause cancer in lab rats.  In humans, the effects of Aspartame can be felt as either migraine, other headache, dizziness, nausea, anxiety, nervousness, or bloating.  PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ON ASPARTAME before you consume any product such as this.  ASPARTAME is rated by the governments as ""GRAS - Generally Regarded As Safe"" - The History of Aspartame is fascinating and you will find that the scientists at the FDA who tested Aspartame advocated it to be banned.  Donald Rumsfeld served as one of the influential political forces that successfully managed to get the FDA to overrule the FDA's own scientists' recommendation that this product be BANNED.  Aspartame's GRAS status means that the US Gov't will do nothing to regulate or prevent its usage.<br /><br />I first started experiencing problems with Fiber-One when I realized that eating a bowl of it without any other food would cause me to feel nauseous.  On occasion, eating a bowl of Fiber-One would give me a migraine along with a feeling of dizziness.  This is certainly not the way that I want to start off the morning.  There are people who can eat Aspartame-laced foods all day long and who are unaware of any side-effects, but they do creep up on you and if you are not as tolerant as some others, WATCH OUT.  You could become very sick eating this cereal day after day, the chemical builds up in your system.  The insidiousness of Aspartame being in Fiber-One is that, if you are health-counscious, you'll tell yourself that if you're not feeling well that you should maybe eat more healthy food - like the very same Fiber-One cereal that's making you sick!!<br /><br />It is unethical and unconscionable for General Mills, a staple brand in this country, to have resorted to using a dangerous chemical additive simply so their Marketing Exec's can push their cereal upon people who are sugar-sensitive.  People with Diabetes BEWARE - Aspartame is known to also cause aggressive insulin responses.  Just because their chemical sweetener contains no calories doesn't mean that your body won't react in that manner, and you may end up on the bad end of an insulin swing as a result.<br /><br />This product should be pulled immediately from the shelves.  I personally am ashamed that a large reputable company such as GM would target a health-conscious individual like myself and yet perform an underhanded trick as adding a chemical sweetener.  I really wish I had noticed the chemical additive in this cereal before I had experienced the headaches and nausea.<br /><br />SHAME ON GENERAL MILLS - BEWARE FIBER ONE CEREAL - I wish I would have been warned before becoming sickened by this ""health cereal""."

I rated this product 1 star because like other reviewers, I too received a 50-ct box of nearly expired product.  When you buy this stuff in the store it has roughly a one year shelf life.  The box I was sent expires in two months.  A box of 50 is like a one year supply for me.  If I had known they are selling these boxes at such a good price because they are about to expire, I would have passed on this ""bargain"".

I am actually scared to purchase vanilla now on the Internet in bulk other than from companies I can find and try out in the stores. I can only speak about the bottle I purchased. I would recommend something else. Most vanilla is gluten free although many have corn syrup in them. This one has sugar in it. I really don't understand positive reviews about this product. I bought it because it was cheap (for the amount) and gourmet. It (I think, tastes worse than the imitation). Imitation at least tastes like vanilla.

I put in the first cup this morning and it made the regular noise, then stopped. I thought maybe something was wrong with my machine so I took out the K-Cup (a mess!) and ran water through the Keurig a few times to ""clean it"". I tried again with another Cafe Caramel K-Cup and got the same results. I think whatever is in the K-Cup itself is too thick to push through the machine. It sputtered a few times spraying caramel everywhere. I tried a third new one with the same results so I just gave up. I tried one of my regular coffee K-Cup right after and it brewed just fine.

That was until my cat became sick for a week and a $350 vet bill to determine the problem was this bag of kibble.  It was easy for the vet to diagnose: I changed my cat's food out on Monday.  By Tuesday, she was showing signs of nausea (non-social, lethargy, eating sparingly, licking her lips a lot).  On Thursday, I took her to the vet.  The vet said she had a fever and was nauseated.

I checked the label before purchasing them b/c while I am all for the idea of organic, I did not want some crazy gluten-free, vegan, tasteless, saw dust biscuit.  These were neither gluten-free nor vegan, passing the test with real ingredients like whole eggs, flour and real chocolate.  I figured I was in for a treat.  WRONG.  Unfortunately, they are dry (even though they're ""soft baked""), and flavorless.  They have that very specific, cardboard, non-flavor that you get with weirdo hippie-food.  (Nothing against weirdo hippies - they're great - it's just that sometimes their packaged food sucks.)<br /><br />Bottom line... if I'm going to indulge, I'd rather eat crappy cookies filed with unpronounceable sludge from some evil multinational.

I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course. The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. I normally expect packaging to be misleading but in the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort.

B003MWBFXY,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,2,4,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

This is not the same tuna it was before.<br /><br />I noticed a decline in quality for some time.  The tuna had a stronger smell.  There was often nuclear-orange glowing color on top of the tuna.  The size of the cans got smaller.  One can used to yield a few sandwiches.  Now you have to open at least two cans for two people.  When you drain the liquid out, the lid goes so far down because there isn't as much tuna as there used to be.  But that isn't the worst part.<br /><br />I noticed this year that every can I've opened has had some sort of sludgy gel-like goo surrounding the tuna.  I touched it to see what it was like and it feels like grimy slime.  I wondered if this was a bad batch (we usually buy lots of cans at a time) or some sort of new way they are packing it.  I looked it up and saw others were finding the same thing in their tuna.  I tried eating some of it after getting most of the goo off.  But it did not taste very good.  I now regret eating it at all after reading the following.<br /><br />Apparently the company was once owned by Del Monte, but was sold to a South Korean tuna company that was hoping to get into the American market.  For what reason?  To poison us?  Seriously, I can't imagine what they put in these cans.  I also read that they refused to provide records to the FDA when asked.  That can't be good.  Why is this stuff still on our store shelves?  Why are American companies selling out to foreign ones all the time?  Americans are finding it harder and harder to afford groceries.  We don't want to spend our money on trash products.  I will never buy Starkist again unless it one day makes its way back to American hands.  There is obviously something wrong with it.  Just look at it and smell it next time you open a can.  It's no longer the tasty tuna of yesteryear.  It is now tuna bits in slimy, tuna-flavored sludge water."

We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box.

Owning my own cat now, I've done some research on available food choices. Meow Mix is one of the cheapest--and one of the worst.<br /><br />Not quite like humans, cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied *or* full. The problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products, carbohydrate-based fillers, and processed meat by-products. Cats are obligate carnivores. The first two ingredients on Meow Mix's list (the ones used in most abundance in the product) are corn. As a result, cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving, causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day.<br /><br />Healthy food results in a healthier cat. Weight control, shedding, disease development, and more are all influenced by a cat's food. The excessive use of carbohydrate-based fillers in cheap cat foods, as part of this reality, can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes.<br /><br />Brands sold in quality pet stores start with Iambs as the ""baseline,"" and even Iambs isn't what I'd call good for your cat. Many of my local shelters feed their cats Iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food. Even better, companies such as Orijen and EVO make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content, which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat. Whatever you decide, check the ingredients list. Make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible. Also make sure those are actual meats. Meats are better then meat meals, and meat meals are ok (and usually unavoidable). Meat by-products are what you want to watch out for.<br /><br />The reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain. Healthy cat food is more expensive, but your cat will eat less of it, helping to mitigate the cost a bit. I recommend premium cat foods for this reason. They're better for your cat in every conceivable way, and they won't break your bank. Even if you are on a budget, consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur. If you are currently using this food, maybe it's time to switch."

I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy. The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life. Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food. I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case. I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.

This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake."

Boo!,"I think I'm pretty well-qualified to comment on the taste of coconut water, having been drinking it since I was a young on visits to India.  Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst."

These products do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals) So if it says ""chicory root"" or ""inulin"" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.

He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.

It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."

B003MA8P02,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,33,48,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

B000QSN7P6,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,33,48,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

This product is so bad that I consider this review to be a public service.  As the title indicates, to say that this coffee is cinnamon roll flavored is total misrepresentation.  There is a very slight scent of cinnamon roll while it is brewing, but the end product has absolutely no cinnamon roll flavor.  The end result is bitter black coffee and nothing more.  I have to wonder if the maker, Green Mountain Coffee, has ever heard of taste testers.  Based on the flavor of this coffee, and flavor of the equally bad ""Chocolate Glazed Donut"", I have to say no.  I think I will throw them away and take the loss rather than subject my taste buds to continued assault by choking down the remaining 23 cups.  The kindest thing I can say about this product is that it is absolutely terrible.  I intend to express my displeasure to the manufacturer as well.  For a product this bad it should be possible to give a zero star rating or better yet, a negative star rating.<br /><br />Based on my experience with both products I will be very reluctant to purchase another ""flavored"" coffee."

B001O023FK,A21J6NI4JKSOK2,I. Garcia,4,5,1,2010-12-24,Bitter Green Tea,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."

B001VL07QO,AKZKG2Z7CNV27,BreezyPaige,1,1,1,2012-03-27,Absolutely Awful Cat Food,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs."" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn."

We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the ""customer service representative"" if you can call her that, simply said ""if you don't like it then don't buy it."" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any ""stickers"" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it."

The taste is noticeable and he will no longer drink it.  It seems ironic that a company who sells whole milk, half and half and heavy whipping cream would eliminate a 2% milk product.  I applaud them for coming out with a lower fat, lower sugar variety- but they could give their (very) loyal customers the option of buying the original version.

Since they both have access to the same food bowl (cat door), it's inconvenient to keep the bulimic kitty away while normal kitty eats.<br /><br />A couple 20 lb. bags ago, kitty ate not-Meow Mix.  I don't recall her puking while eating that food.  Now it's time for more research.<br /><br />I'm changing cat foods when this bag runs low.  I'll also start weighing the cat food to find out how much she's eating at a time and per day.  If the puking stops with new food, I'll reintroduce meow mix and see if it returns.

I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course.The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. In the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort.

B000FL08B0,A1TQIPT2QBAS6Z,Ddanimal,3,7,1,2011-02-07,"Agave ""nectar"" is a scam","from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you."

What you get is a small bonsai tree with one main branch and maybe 7 inches in lenght. My tree goes up about 1 and 1/2 inch out the ground then curves at a right angle. I am disappointing but using some wire I should be able to make it look unique I hope.<br /><br />When I arrived home to get the package, it looked like UPS played kickball with the package. There was a big dent in the box like someone stomped on it. Luckily, the tree survived. Since, I have been taking extreme care of it. I water it every Sunday. I give it indirect sunlight and sometimes take it outside on the porch for fresh air.

B002PI82P0,A1F7NPONOI6KP7,espresso lover,4,7,1,2011-02-21,This espresso machine looks pretty and makes horrible espresso,"This expresso machine is horrible... my last machine belonged to my parents and was gifted to me, it lasted over 20 years, it made consistent espresso and was wonderful, not saeco brand.. when it died I decided to put some money into replacing it with a nice machine hoping that it would last years, and make wonderful lattes. I make lattes 2 times a day and always use Starbucks coffee beans fresh and kept in the freezer until use. From the day it arrived, this machine made horrible coffee... but since I ordered it from Amazon and spent over 800 after shipping on it I decided to give it a while to see if I could get it to work better. I adjusted the grind, and the dose and tried over and over. What I found is that the espresso was very inconsistent, the red error light would go off multiple times during use. Sometimes it would make a somewhat decent shot of espresso and then I would adjust nothing and the next time it would shoot out watery crap, or it would drip out half a shot and stop. It has been so infuriating. Finally after a month I called customer service to complain they told me I should be priming the pump with each use of the machine... which I tried, for about 2 cups I thought it was fixed then I was back to square one. Now after another month I am at my wits end. I wake up every morning hope it's going to make a decent cup, and end up drinking a watery cup of awful latte... grumpy until I decide to purchase a latte somewhere later in the day. I'm done hoping, like my husband says you can piss in one hand and wish in the other and see which one fills up first.. Today I am calling to return this awful piece of junk... and hopefully I will at least get my money back. Never will I purchase another product from this company, what a disappointment.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Since Amazon doesn't show all ingredients, I had to look them up at the store, and I was shocked when I saw Carrageenan as one of them on this milk!! CARRAGEENAN: a seaweed derivative used in a wide variety of foods and cosmetics. In its native form, it has not been classified as a carcinogen, but in it's degraded or broken down form it has been classified as a possible human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Joanne Tobacman, M.D., University of Iowa assistant professor of clinical internal medicine, and researcher on carrageenan, said ""There seems to be enough evidence associating carrageenan with significant gastrointestinal lesions, including malignancies, to avoid ingesting it."" According to Dr. Tobacman, the native carrageenan, after being subjected to stomach acids may be broken down into the degraded form and be a cancer risk. And even if it wasn't, carrageenan cannot be identified as native or degraded on food labels, so there is no way of knowing if you are ingesting carrageenan, the carcinogen or not."

Probably my own fault; I should have specified ""No MSG"", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!<br />Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better.

When I received the shipment, which was delivered promptly, I found that the burlap sack it comes in has a zipper at the top, but when un-zipped it is stitched shut and needs to be cut open. This is not a problem, as the sack says it is ""tamper proof"", however the inner plastic bag containing the rice was already open and small particles of burlap threads must have fallen onto the rice whilst cutting open the sack. Not to mention a large quantity of rice had already spilled outside the inner bag. When I attempted to remove the inner plastic bag it burst open and about half of the rice fell all over the floor. So I had to spend the next 20 min. cleaning up this huge mess of rice. I can't believe how tissue-thin the inner plastic bag is!

I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side."

I think because it came out all creamy which made me wonder what was in it apart from the spices, etc. I had to throw the rest of the unused pods out because I wouldn't want to give them to anyone else.

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!"

B005MSH1XY,AEOCEVUWO5B7P,Jason M. Page,2,3,1,2011-09-02,Terrible Root Beer,"I was pretty excited to see this product recently at a local store, because I like root beer quite a bit.  My wife and I greatly enjoy our Soda Stream machine, and have been fairly satisfied with most of the syrups that we have purchased, but we do prefer sugar sweetened drinks to ones that include Sucralose, which all of the standard soda stream flavors have.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I regret buying this flavor.<br /><br />This syrup has a weak taste.  Even adding more syrup does not help.  Additionally I can't taste any of the hints of nutmeg, allspice, or other spicy flavors that a good root beer should have.  I happened to look at the label and see that the product was developed in Israel.  Maybe they should have had some Americans help them develop the flavor since apparently the nice folks in Israel don't know what root beer is supposed to taste like.  I have sampled literally dozens of different root beers over the years, including many of the boutique ones that are sweetened with cane sugar.  This one ranks on the bottom as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />They should reformulate it.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the dispenser cap is of a particular awful design for pouring the large amount of syrup needed into the Soda Stream carbonator bottle.  Would it kill soda stream to develop a bottle that had a built in spout on the cap for easier dispensing of the product?<br /><br />Also, considering that you get only the equivalent of about 18 12 ounce ""cans"" worth of product in this $10 bottle it is questionable if you are really saving anything over buying decent quality product at your local grocer.  Whole Foods for example has a really good quality root beer that is sweetened with cane sugar, tastes 100X better than this one and costs about $3.99 for a six pack."

B002T0IHPO,A33ZYFE8XMKKR1,"P. Scott Pope ""Scott Pope""",31,36,1,2012-07-15,What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore."

I think it took a detour through a waste dump before ending up in my mailbox.<br />I have had Lapsang Souchong at Pete's Coffee & Tea  and was very impressed by the smokey flavor. So I tried it from other blenders and most often liked it (Twinning's bagged version of the tea isn't bad, but it's like listening to an opera by echo). I took a chance on this brand and really wish I wouldn't have; this has got to be the worst flavored Lapsang Souchong I have ever had. The flavor of the tea is as if it was smoked over construction waste and rotten wood. I've tried 8 cups of it so far using different steeping times and water temperatures and am continually disappointed. I am not sure what I'm going to do with the rest of this tea other than to help acidify my normally  base garden soil.<br /><br />Yuk!"

B001E5DYM6,A1WF0MV0ISZJL6,Larry Bouchard,34,38,1,2008-01-14,Beware - dusty and stale,"I recently ordered these and was extremely disappointed.  Here were the problems:<br /><br />1) OLD!!  They actually tasted dusty and I could feel no potency in them at all.<br />2) Wolfberries not Goji Berries.  Since I've consumed Goji's from many sources over the years, I know which are the highest quality Goji's (usually quite expensive), which are less potent, and which are the different tasting Wolfberry variety that many sellers pass off as Goji's but are not the same.  Wolfberry has its own benefits (not nearly those of Goji IMO), but for Wolfberries these are widly overpriced.  You can get the same in Chinese stores for probably closer to $10 for twice the amount.<br /><br />With the dollar devaluation top quality Goji berries have gotten very expensive for regular use.  So if you're looking for cheaper alternatives like I was here, look elsewhere.  Check out some of the cheap goji berries (that are in fact wolfberries and usually say so) on Ebay from Chinese sources.  They'll be quite a bit cheaper and likely quite a bit fresher."

After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>"

B002KLLHF4,A3TU6YWGLGDGFC,Port Louis,0,0,1,2012-10-15,Disappointed,"For years now I've been curious about ""this leaf"" from South America. I've often seen it mentioned and tried on various travel programs, usually with glowing comments. Not knowing that the product was available in the USA, until recently I never tried it. A few weeks, ago while surfing Amazon, there in front of me were various products made with coca leaves. I was actually quite astonished as I was convinced it was unavailable here. With my adventurous nature I ordered a number of the products, some powdered, some whole leaves and some with roughly crushed leaves. I read up on various ways the leaves should be tried, from tea, chewing whole leaves with some added alkali as well as a sundry of other methods. I went into this exploration with a very positive attitude. Unfortunately I was soon disappointed. I don't believe that any of the products, no matter how they were used, had any effect on me whatsoever. While it's true that if you leave the product in touch with the tongue or gums it produces numbness, apart from that...... absolutely no effect whatsoever. Having spent almost $200 on these products needless to say I was quite annoyed.<br /><br />Surfing Google about the leaves available in the USA, apparently some, if not most or all of these products are modified to make them legal in this country. Just as you can buy decaffeinated coffee, these products can be modified or treated to remove many of the active chemicals native to this leaf. My guess is that the products I purchased were modified in this way, contrary to the assertions of the sellers.<br /><br />In view of this the best way to try these leaves is to book a trip to South America, something I don't plan on doing myself.<br /><br />As the saying goes, you win some and you loose some. With these leaves, I lost them all.<br /><br />I invite the supplier to comment on my review.<br /><br />Addendum  10/25/12<br /><br />Regarding the processing of the product prior to sale, I have been advised by Pijama Cafe and the Mysterious Bolivian that ""we only sell what it is under regulations."" I can only interpret that to mean that much of the alkaloid content has been reduced prior to selling the product..because as they state  ""we only sell what it is under regulations.""<br /><br />The home page on their website states<br /><br />""As coffee can be decaffeinated, the coca tea can also be decocainized. Just like ""decaf"" coffee does retain a minute quantity of caffeine, ""Decocainized"" coca tea will still contain a minute quantity of the drug. When the cocaine is removed, the amount of cocaine is small enough for the product to legally sell in the USA according to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs ""Wikipedia"" .........  ""  ""Some of our coca products are produced under processes that controls the amount of illegal alkaloids leaving behind only the beneficial alkaloids.""<br /><br />The notes above appears to answer all questions as to whether the product is or isn't processed."

However, after a few weeks of usage we noticed that there was a build-up of grime and dried food inside the handle. This occurs when the preparation bowl is very full during cooking and some of the steam and food enter the hollow handle. This is unavoidable and it is impossible to clean this out again. Why on earth they chose to place the opening of a hollow handle right next to the lip of the preparation bowl is beyond me.

Don't be fooled by the marketing or the bright colors on it. Read the ingredients. Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils (Cottonseed, Soybean and Rapeseed) to Prevent Separation, Salt. Sugar is the #2 ingredient in this stuff! Cottonseed oil??? The seed oils aren't even in their natural state: they are hydrogenated which means that they are the equivalent of saturated fats (not polyunsaturated which one could argue might be beneficial). Can you say heart attack in a bottle? Before you go saying this is ""Great for kids"" think about whether you really want your kids or family eating this crap. Maybe it's cheap, but the doctor bills down the road won't be."
B003M5TG28,A3B2IP2Q0CUBI6,azcatlover,5,7,1,2011-06-19,Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard,"I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real."

Granted, the difference is not huge. What bugs me is it's essentially candy masquerading as ""healthy"". Also, with both the fiber is fairly negligible. I'm not saying they come right out and say it's ""healthy"" but they certainly do imply it.<br /><br />Lets talk about cost. There are 10 packages in a box. Each package is .6oz. I paid about 3.40 for my box. I paid that for about 6-7 ounces of product. So if I were buying them by the pound, I guess that would be over 8.00 for 1 pound. For that price, I can buy myself a nice steak.<br /><br />As I said before, these do taste good but I find the cost is prohibitive and they aren't really any better for you than candy and are very small. I doubt I'll be buying them again and for sure they are not an ""indulgence"" I would feel good about giving to kids."

Advise NOT to buy from Amazon if you want fresh ground coffee that is NOT stale.  Better option is to buy Melitta from their web site which often has sales at half price (well below Amazon's best price).  Their coffee (Melitta-dot-com) is always fresh direct from their roasting factory and just as good as this brand.  I have had this coffee (Douwe Egberts) before while visiting in England (UK) and when fresh it is great, but can not understand Amazon sending stale coffee to their customers.  I see from the other review that I am not the only customer to receive stale coffee from Amazon.  SHAME on Amazon for sending old food/beverage items to their customers without stating in the item description that the product is very old (no longer fresh).

I tried the dough again, EW! Still awful. Unfortunately I was out of my allergy-friendly chocolate chips because this mix desperately needed some more chocolate chips! I cooked them hoping the flavor would improve. Taking other reviewer's advice, I cooked them a little long because the reviews said that is what makes the bean flavor go away.

Unfortunately, the ingredients did not mention that there are RAISINS in this product. The combination of apples, raisins and cinnamon is not a good idea at all. My baby actually started gagging when I put a spoonful in her mouth. When I tasted it myself, I felt like doing the same. This mixture is just too sweet because of the raisins. There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it one more try by mixing apple puree with a little bit of this mixture and see if the baby will take it or not. Otherwise, it's all going in the trash. I hate wasting food but there doesn't seem to be another option."

He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone."

B003MWBFXY,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,18,24,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

B000ANO3N2,A32F7XPPKIILVC,Leeshie R,3,3,1,2011-08-22,Not our best idea,"As a treat to our 2 year old ACD mix, we bought this bone for her.  She loves her nylabone durachew (much to my dismay) and we were aware that this one was actually edible before we bought it.  We don't often give her treats like this, and she really seemed to love it.  So much so, in fact, that the entire thing was nearly gone within 10 minutes..... and we purchased the largest one - the one with the first on the end since our dog is 50+ lbs.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling about it, and a few hours later, it was confirmed.  My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.<br /><br />If you do purchase this product, definitely make sure you watch your dog with it - if they're eating it too fast, consider taking it away so they don't devour the entire thing in 10 minutes like ours did."

With that in mind, take this review with a grain of salt, as I'm comparing them to normal regular foods.<br /><br />The recipe on the side of the can calls for 2 cups of mix. the can itself is 2 and 2/3 cups in size. What pray tell are you supposed to do with that extra 2/3 cup of mix is beyond me, but i guess that since your getting a 4 pack, they expect you to combine them and make an extra batch.<br /><br />The cakes cook up nice and fluffy: if you use an egg instead of oil (recipe says you can sub one for the other). The one thing i can't seem to get my head around, or fix is that they always seem gritty. I blend them, I wisk them, I puree the batter but the grit is always there.<br /><br />Not nearly the worst part is the metallic after taste, if I wanted to put something in my mouth that tasted like a penny... I would be using a penny. It may be smaller, but is far less work, frustration, and money.<br /><br />on that note... stay away from this unless you MUST have organic pancake mix.

B009GHI5Q4,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,3,3,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

B002TSA91Q,A3FON4I2FXE0NQ,Debashish Mitra,2,6,1,2010-09-07,"Clog Your Pores, Stay Dirty, Feel Stale","This is the worst body wash I have ever used and I have used a few (from most regular mass market products like Axe, Old Spice to designer brands like Armani, Dunhill). The things that I expect from a bodywash/shower gel are:<br /><br />1) It should clean you very well and leave you feeling fresh (BUT while doing so it should not dry your skin). In the long run it should be good for the skin.<br /><br />2) It should not have any ingredient which is harmful for the skin. Specifically I avoid the following like plague: Petrolatum, Parben, Mineral Oil (apart from these, I also try to avoid SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate) but it is hard to find a body wash or shower gel without SLS - its pervasive).<br /><br />3) Have a good soothing or invigorating fragrance (while not being so strong as to cause a headache)<br /><br />Before beginning this review let me tell you why I avoid the ingredients Petrolatum, Parben and Mineral Oil - all these ingredients, in the name of 'moisturizing your skin by locking in vital moisture' actually form a sheath on top of your skin and clog its pores. This is extremely unhealthy for the skin since skin, for being healthy, needs to be able to breathe freely for expelling impurities out of the system. The implication of using products (body washes, shower gels) with these ingredients is that you do not feel as fresh after the shower (compared to products  without these ingredients) since your skin pores are clogged and suffocated. Though I noticed that this Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash contained Petrolatum (and SLS), I wanted to give it a try since I hold in high regard Unilever in general for their well engineered products and the Dove brand in particular for their moisturizing bar soap which is one of the best soaps for skin and is a fantastic product.<br /><br />However I was shocked when I used this. It is the worst of all worlds - This body wash almost does not clean you at all but leaves such a heavy residue on your skin that you will feel horrible - as if you did not have a shower at all. And dare you use this when you are a little more unclean than usual - when you come out of the shower you will wonder whether you had a shower at all. There is absolutely NO feeling of freshness OR cleanliness that you expect from a shower. Now some might argue that usually 'moisturizing' body washes are intended more to moisturize than to leave you feeling squeaky clean - well I'm not talking of anything even close to squeaky clean here - when you have a bath (even if it were with the world's most moisturizing soap/body wash) you expect to feel a minimal level of freshness (otherwise there is no point of a bath - you might as well smother yourself with moisturizing lotion instead).<br /><br />Ok - so this does a horrible job of cleaning. So what about its claims of moisturizing ? The only thing this body wash does is clog your pores and leave your skin feeling suffocated - not supple and well cared for. So if you have an oily skin or if you are a little stale from perspiration and get into the shower with this, you will feel horrible since this will 1) not clean you in any way 2) lock in the dirt that you had before the shower - can you imagine how bad that can feel ? I wonder whether this product was well tested on actual people (which is a basic requirement and the norm with any cosmetic manufacturer of credibility/repute) before being rolled out.<br /><br />As for the fragrance, its just OK. Nothing that you would look forward to.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly disappointed with Unilever for releasing such a badly engineered and tested product. This is extremely uncharacteristic of this very good FMCG company. I threw this in the bin after using it thrice (I was disgusted after the very first use but wanted to give this a chance just in case the first day was a 'bad bath day' - but alas the bad was not in the day - it was in the gel).<br /><br />Well this review was a passionate one and so could come across to some as bordering on the weird - for after all its a body wash isn't it ? Your life does not depend on it. But well, I am very particular about the decisions I make for my health, grooming and well being. This product was so horrible that it disgusted me to the extent necessary to elicit such strong feelings of dislike and disapproval. However, as I always suggest, do not take my word for it - try this yourself (if you want) with an open mind but at the same time being conscious of what to test/look for after reading this review - because after all you are the best judge of what suits you and what is good for you. Also, I strongly suggest that you try to find a cleaning product without SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate), since SLS penetrates the skin and even the internal organs easily and can cause havoc like endocrinological imbalances, neurological disorders, organ toxicity and cancer on long term use."

We first tried the non-lethal castor/garlic oil water spray method (twice).  It didn't work. Then we tried laying two of the Victor Out of Sight Mole Trap out.  That didn't work, either. Finally, my son spot movement in the lawn and he stomped on the tunnel.  The mole was dead. It was small, only about 4 inches.  But, it was amazing, that was the end of our problem.  Our entire lawn - which isn't small - was destroyed by ONE tiny mole.  Best advise, look for the movement of the mole in the late afternoon, than stomp on it or use a flat end of a large shovel. Moles have thin skulls so apparently they are easy to kill. One mole can do an incredible amount of damage.<br /><br />5/31/10 update:<br /><br />New season, new mole appears. Instead of using the mole trap, I tried a new approach--- kill his food source. One application of grub and insect killer and the mole is gone, probably to the neighbors yard. Everything I read on the internet suggest that you have to kill the mole but that has remained elusive except by luck. Getting rid of his food source though worked immediately.

Instead I got snacks that were priced at .25 per package suitable for vending machine use and of less face value than the purchase price. Even Amazon's free shipping can't offset the overpricing and if you order direct from UTZ the shipping doubles that overpriced amount.<br />Definitely not worth the price particularly when local retailers sell the same brand product at 4-5 times the size for under a dollar.<br />This multipack is in my opinion just UTZ's way of maximizing unwarranted profits from unknowing online customers. Seriously, 'buy direct from us for double the price anywhere else' just doesn't work for me.<br />They have just informed me by email that they will stop putting in the marked packages - so you won't know what the retail value is of what you are buying.  You are better off, in my opinion, buying this product in the store, if you must have it, or out of a vending machine than from Amazon or even direct from UTZ."

B001VIYCK4,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,18,24,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

I have been feeding the Chicken & Pea L.I.D to my cats for months now & they have been doing great off of it as you can see from my previous review on this product. Then, in mid February 2012, I opened a new bag for my cats and the coloring of the crunchies were a much darker color than they used to be & my cats wouldn't even eat it! So I went and purchased a new bag from a different store to see if the 1st bag was just a bad batch & this time the crunchies looked normal, however within a week, one of my cats got blood covered stool (which took 3 months to go away!), and my cat with the sensitive stomach started acting mopey & sick. After 2 weeks he would barely walk around. Several tests later the vet found that his intestines were swollen along with his stomach lymph nodes & he had developed pancreatitis. He's off the food now but still recouping. Apparently my cat isn't the only one with problems recently with the Limited Ingredient dry crunchies according to reviews on consumeraffairs.com! Customers on there have the same complaints with the cat & dog dry L.I.D food over the past few months of it doing the same thing to their animals too! Natural Balance doesn't have my business any more, that is until they no longer have Diamond Pet Foods package their products. After doing some background research on Natural Balance, Diamond Pet Foods (who packages for them) has constant recalls & complaints. They have one going on right now actually & were one of the biggest culprits during the 2007 major pet food recall.  Just keep an eye on your pets if you purchase this, and also watch for a runny nose or sneezing, my cat no longer does either since taking him off of this food.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Five Stars!!!! One of my cats has a very sensitive stomach but does VERY well on these crunchies! And my other cat had bad dandruff but after a couple of months on this food its completely gone! Her coat looks beautiful and she doesn't frantically lick her back anymore! Both of my cats seemed to prefer this flavor over the salmon L.I.D but all cats are different. So glad Natural Balance makes this!"

ZERO STARS,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb."

I really enjoyed this coffee every morning for over a year.  However after extended use, I started becoming very irritable in my day, insomnia, ect. After seeing doctors for PMS and everything else, I just got on the web and searched for ""caffeine sensitivity"".  I learned a little something about coffee from a website,  ineedcoffee dot com.<br /><br />Dark roasts are terribly unhealthy for you! Dark Roasts break down the sugar and oils and burn the coffee bean to a crisp and you are left with ash material. Not many people can tolerate this and will experience unpleasant side effects which lead you to believe your falling apart when really it's an adversion to the dark roasted beans. It only took one cup in the morning to affect my overall health.<br /><br />So as much as I enjoy this super dark roasted coffee, I must make the switch to the light roast.  At least now, I am able to determine if it is a quality coffee bean or not because it is not charcoal."

This product lacks flavor and is way too heavy and dense. I also don't know what could be nastier than unsweetened coconut. It needs to be lighter in texture and a lot sweeter (not cloyingly so) and then this might be at least tasty. As it is, it is a waste of money and an absolute disappointment.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: look for inspiration in the flourless chocolate cake sold at Trader Joe specifically for gluten free diets, and check out the flavorful almond horn by Aleia. Both are mildly sweet, but full of flavor.  The chocolate flavor pops in the mouth and makes you forget that it has no gluten in it.  The almond horn delights you with the fragrance before it ever hits your mouth.  Both go great with tea, coffee and fruit, particularly the cake goes well with fresh stawberries.<br /><br />Maybe you just need to stick to a core ingredient and work around it.  There is too much nastiness going on in this disgusting bar.<br /><br />This is a terrible product that cannot be recommended. There are just way too many nasty gluten free products on the market, and this should be placed exactly where I just put it, in the garbage. More $$ down the drain and continued disappointment reigns.<br /><br />I am being brutally honest because I was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy and have exceedingly fond memories of all of the delicious wheat-based offerings I used to eat and I naturally expect to be able to partake delicious gluten-free substitutes, espcially since they usually cost twice as much as the products containing gluten. This is no substitute for the wheat-based version, to say the least."

I added some ""Zero"". It didn't dissolve. I stirred. Still didn't dissolve. I let it sit for a while, still didn't dissolve. Tried sipping it - all of the ""Zero"" was still at the bottom. Shook ferociously. Left on counter for hours, thinking room temp would help. (Nope) Five days later, the ""Zero"" in the see-thru sport bottle, still hadn't dissolved. I eventually poured it out. (As an odd note: It left a white film on the lip of the bottle opening.)<br /><br />So I brewed a 1/2 gallon of green tea and added some ""Zero"" to it while it was still warm. It dissolved.

B001AWBZQK,A2Z2G40JVYIVKR,garzascreek,0,0,1,2012-10-01,My cat hates it now.,"This used to be my cat's favorite treat (it wasn't daily fare).  It used to have a great texture.  Now it is dry and unpalatable.  I agree with Mars' review here. I thought it was maybe just a bad batch but over time it has proven to be either a new formulation or maybe just a less fatty part of the tuna being used.  It is also clear that Natural Value is fraudulently claiming  AAFCO compliance in their formulation.  Under pressure from  misguided pet owners and Internet cranks this manufacturer removed menadione from their fish based formulations. AFFCO requires the use of vitamin K3 (menadione) in any cat food product containing greater than 25% fish on a dry matter basis, and for good reason. I have labels from previous and new cans and the new ones clearly do not list the required vitamin K supplementation.  So, Natural Value is either lying about the actual ingredients or about the AAFCO label statement.  In either case, I can't trust this company anymore.  I used to buy their cat food by the case at Whole Foods.  If your cat happens to like this product, I think it would be OK only as a treat (since it does have a great basic ingredients list), definitely not as a regular entire meal. Even if this were a trustworthy product, it is probably best to limit exposure for cats to apex predators (that accumulate toxins) like tuna anyway."

B003MW7858,A3B2IP2Q0CUBI6,azcatlover,5,7,1,2011-06-19,Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard,"I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real."

My son is 11 months and eats everything I put in front of him, but this Ella's Kitchen chicken meal (along with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081ZAVLE"">ELLA'S KITCHEN Oh So Creamy Chicken and Corn Mash, 4.5-Ounce (Pack of 7)</a>) is something he refuses to eat. I literally spoon it in his mouth and he sticks out his tongue and pushes it out as quick as he can.<br /><br />The only way I got him to eat this is by mixing it with fruit baby food (with a ratio of 2:1 fruit to chicken). I recommend sticking with homemade chicken. I have not tried other meat-based baby foods but given how Ella's Kitchen tends to be incredibly tasty, I can only imagine how bad other brands' food must be."
B004JRXZKM,A1GEPBQYM2D842,T. Rodgers,7,8,1,2011-08-04,Taste is fine but texture induces nausea,"I read the very mixed reviews, and thought this would be worth a try.  The general advice seemed to say 'follow the directions closely' and try to use a thicker, non-tomato based, sauce.  So, here is my experience:<br /><br />1.  Opened the package.  It smells of the sea - fishy.  The noodles themselves have no color, opaque.<br /><br />2.  Rinsed the noodles off in a colander.  The fishy smell mostly went away.<br /><br />3.  Placed the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />4.  Poured the noodles back into the colander.  The noodles are now a white color and hardly opaque, so to 'blanche' has a dual meaning here.<br /><br />5.  Dried noodles, per instructions.<br /><br />6.  Doused noodles in an Alfredo sauce.<br /><br />Took a bite.  The taste is fine.  The noodles are slimy and nearly impossible to chew.  Took a second bite.  Almost threw up.  Ate some veggies and tried again, with the exact same results.<br /><br />My wife had the exact same opinion.  We didn't want to traumatize the kid's with this, because it's hard enough getting them to eat the good stuff.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that the texture is just unbearable, it literally induced nausea in both of us.  The fishy smell I can deal with, it was quite faint, but maybe that plays a part too.<br /><br />We'll give it another shot, once we build up some courage or completely forget last night.  If that doesn't change things, then what packs are left will get handed out to friends, since it seems that many have a different opinion."

But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo."

B009GHI5Q4,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,19,21,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.

B001BCVY4W,A10U8DJAPJJI8I,"William Hefner ""William Van Hefner""",3,5,1,2008-11-29,#1 Ingredient is Mostly Water,"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a ""fair shake"", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a ""bad batch"" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat ""favorites"" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into ""fish broth"", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on ""fish water"" doesn't sound like a good deal to me."

I USED TO buy lots of it because I loved it. It was nice and crumbly for salads and omelets and a bunch of other recipes. Flavoful with a long shelf life.<br />NOT ANY MORE.<br />I was surprised when I opened a package to crumble it into my salad and it wasn't crumbly. No different than any sliceable cheese. I figured it just a labeling mistake and returned it to the store. A while later, same thing and I returned it to the store. I dug down to the bottom of the heap and found the last 3 packages of REAL feta. You can even see the difference from the outside of the package. This is part of the description on their own website, ""This DRY,CRUMBLY cheese is excellent in dishes with vegetables"". The label picture is exactly the same as the one I buy (and I just looked again today).<br />I emailed Mount Sterling, politely explaing the situation. I figured they'd want to know. I received a curt reply telling me that I was welcome to return it to the store. Then about a month ago I decided to try once again, even though it still didn't look like feta through the package. I bought it anyway and it isn't nice crumbly feta so I returned it again. I have checked other cops and it is the same.<br />I like their cheeses including the raw milk chedder but I'll not be so likely to buy from a company<br />that doesn't care about either explaining or correcting a problem. It doesn't exactly make me trust the quality.<br />They may sell this feta now, but as soon as the buyers try to crumble it, they won't be buying any more. I am very disappointed, as I loved this cheese."

I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils.

It's bare dirt, dry, sheltered from the wind.<br /><br />I used about half of the package, which claims to cover 300 square feet, on this area that's approximately 75 square feet. I didn't intend to overdose it so badly, but it's very hard to estimate how much you're shaking out over what square footage. (In case you don't feel like doing the math, that means i used about twice as much per square foot as the packaging says is necessary.)<br /><br />Day 1: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, sniffed around, and meandered off. I didn't see him set foot in that space all day.<br /><br />Day 2: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, dug a hole, and did his business.<br /><br />So even at double strength, this product deterred a housecat for all of approximately one day. One windless, rainless day. That hardly seems like something worth spending money on.<br /><br />And speaking of money, you're paying for something that is, by weight, less than 1% active ingredients. That means about 0.8 ounces of this product is important, and the rest is filler. And those active ingredients are basically black pepper and a little bit of something like cayenne pepper. You can buy a 2-3 ounce container of black pepper at any grocery store for a few dollars, so why pay more than $20 for this? Even if it worked, it would be a waste of money."

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."

The answer is...very, very bad.<br /><br />I like cinammon but the cinammon in this cookie was both overpowering and artificial tasting. Something was just ""off"" and ""too strong"" about them. It might be whatever other ""natural flavors"" are in the cookie and not just the cinammon, I'm not sure, but something just didn't work and the cookie had a bad aftertaste. My 11 year old son said he thought they had a bad ""before"" and ""middle"" taste too! I can't argue with him there.<br /><br />The dried fruit bits were equally bothersome. They made the cookie difficult to eat as the bits were too chewy and stuck in my teeth. I don't want to have to pick fruit bits out of my teeth when I eat a cookie.<br /><br />All in all, this cookie was a huge disappointment.  My children wouldn't even take a second bite of the cookies and I wasn't too thrilled about eating more myself.

B003ANFMY8,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,33,48,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

The white fibers looked like tiny, white strings.  We continued on with the project because we knew we would not be eating it but soon we discovered, the cinnamon didn't even work for the ornaments.  The ornaments crumbled apart once they were dry rather than sticking together.  Lets just say, I'm so thankful we did not purchase this cinnamon to bake with or to eat!!  We were so excited to the GREAT deal on cinnamon but in the end it was not worth it.  We have had to repurchase cinnamon at our local grocery store."

Well, I ordered three products, this and other two chicken.  Immediately noticed that the Chicken Jerky and Grilled Chicken were in package printed ""MADE IN CHINA"" ?!!

Not sure I understand Del Monte option to put out a product line that any of the line is made in china and then advertise that the product are created in USA.  Very confusing and now I don't trust the packaging that states USA.  Hmmm, a real shame as the dogs LOVE these brand treats... but not going to use any longer as concern for their health."

I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like ""THREE DOG BAKERY"" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label ""MADE IN CHINA"" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it.

Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.

Wanting to try something different, I ordered 2 1lb bags of Tres Rios valdivia whole bean coffee THRU AMAZOM.COM. Upon opening the first bag I noticed a difference in quality that was quite apparent. I assumed it was probably because of the different type of coffee, and only after opening the second bag did I think of looking for a freshness date on the packaging. Now I ordered this coffee on July 30 and received it on August 3rd but the package has a freshness date of JUN 12(lot # 11173407).

It gets industrialized of course! This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.<br /><br />Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying ""I told you so"" ever since this version was released. If so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside ZICO must have hated it too. Whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged I'm sure..."

I was excited when I found this in the Supermarket, particularly when I saw no MSG in the ingredients. I do use their other broths quite a lot so I am familiar with their products and am usually satisfied.<br /><br />Part of the reason I make my own is to avoid MSG and other items but lack of MSG aside this stuff is terrible. It's bland and by shortcutting by using spice extracts and lime oil it just doesn't taste good. Plus by having lemon juice and lime oil in up-front it ends up with that 'cooked citrus' taste by the time its heated for use. This product would be improved by leaps and bounds just by eliminating the lemon juice and lime oil - lime is added at serving anyway. The broth also needs to be infused with the roasted spices, not just tweaked with extracts, IMHO. Plus by eliminating sea salt and using small amounts of good quality fish sauce there would be a far more rounded and balanced flavor. All in all I think if I need a quick pho fix I will need to look elsewhere. Pity."

The coconut water tasted very strange, with a strong aftertaste, and there was a milky substance in the water, which I've never seen before (I've been drinking Zico for a while). The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a ""slightly imperfect"" batch to Amazon to get rid of it. I've had this experience with canned beans, food bars, and now Zico.

When I found my package on the porch today it looked like UPS had dragged it behind the truck all the way here.<br />It was not in a rectangular shape any longer. After opening it I saw that the good people at Amazon had wrapped the whole case of jars with bubble wrap. I felt much better when I saw this. I even had trouble getting the wrap off the case of jars, but when I did,the first thing I smelled was Anchovies. Not good! Then I saw that a quarter of the top of the case was wet with olive oil. Even worse! Then I saw that the tape that Crown Prince had sealed the case up with had been cut open. I don't think it would have made it out their door this way personally. Now I love Amazon and spend so much money with them I should be part owner by now, but I will have to say this was done at their warehouse and someone saw the oil on the case and cut it with a knife to look inside the case and just shipped it anyway. I have four jars that are covered in oil and no way of knowing really which ones are leaking. I suspect that it must be one or all of those four. Now while I have not looked close enough at the four yet to see if there is a fine crack in the bottles or the lids are loose, I have read in others comments where their jars were broken. I have them sitting on a piece of printer paper to see which ones leak. Now I don't know how many of you have ever eaten bad seafood before, but I have and don't ever want to do it again!  So now I have eighteen jars of anchovies at a rather high price to begin with, and really don't know if any of them are safe to eat. My point here is to let you know if your going to order any food from Amazon, don't order anything in a glass jar. I wouldn't want to read about you in the obits.

I gave the food to a friend with younger cats, thinking strong teeth would be better suited to this item--but they had no interest in the food either.  They actually removed it from the bowl and ate only their regular food, which was mixed in to make the transfer to a new food easier. I finally ended up putting it outside for the neighborhood feral cat.  He ate it.  But then, I suspect he is starving.  (I live in a very rural area where no shelters exist or I would make an effort to help him; as it is, I just feed him.) Maybe another of the Blue Buffalo products would work, but I opted for Purina One Beyond for my cat which is available at my local stores, costs considerably less, also contains nutritious food and was an instant hit here with my old kitty.  My cat does have a sensitive stomach, and the Purina caused no stomach distress.  I cannot attest to the Blue Buffalo on that count as she would not eat it at all."

The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, ""natural,"" flavored bones and thought.... ""SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!"" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great."

At first, this was a wonderful product.<br /><br />Later, I started finding the bad can occasionally - where the taste was akin to either the product having a metallic reaction with the can, or the product tasting like it had gone bad. But it didn't happen often enough to make me quit buying it.<br /><br />In the last few months, I've purchased more bad cans than good ones. I've written to their company, and called, numerous times. They don't seem too interested in my findings, sadly.<br /><br />Just now, I read another reviewer's comments stating that Thai Kitchen was bought out about a year ago. That seems to coincide with when my dis-satisfaction with the product began. Not only is the taste often bad; but formerly there would be a nice thick lump of cream at the top of the can, and a bunch of thin watery milk at the bottom - as one would want.  Now, however, the product is as thin as coffee creamer all the way through. It never thickens upon refrigeration, either. Clearly, there is NOT as much fat in the product as formerly. So disappointing!<br /><br />I wanted a product without sodium metabisulfate - which is a huge allergy trigger. The other recommended brands like Chao Koh have the sodium metabisulfate. Thai Kitchen does add guar gum, but I can live with that. If only they could keep their quality consistently good!<br /><br />I'm testing A Taste of Thai presently, which is more coconutty tasting, but is very thin and I'm not sure if I like the taste yet (there is an extra fruitiness that I can't quite identify and it is a little overpowering.)<br /><br />It shouldn't be this hard to get a good prepared coconut milk!"

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."

This ingredient, when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) creates Benzene which is carcinogenic (cancer causing).<br /><br />I used to use Splenda or generic sucralose packets, but they made a mess on the counter, took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk, and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners. EZ sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic. I had to find a better option. I find that the only super easy way around using EZ sweet but also save on space/mess is to use the splenda mini tablets. They are pricey and will cost a lot more than the packets, so I've recently found another option. I can now purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the Splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water to make the equivalent of 2,500 packets of Splenda. The cost of the 1oz powder is only $24.95. I found that other companies sell sucralose powder and if you buy a lot of it, it's even cheaper. I don't know how I would measure out 1oz to make a 4 oz bottle of sweetener solution so, for me, it's just easier to get 1oz, it will last us a while and the 4oz bottle on the coffee counter doesn't take up much space at all. I'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives (colloidal silver, GSE, natural salts, citric acid) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus. If you're going to go this route, do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one you love, please leave a comment to this review.<br /><br />Note: I was lucky that the splendex company agreed to give me a 4oz bottle to use for my sucralose solution, I'm not sure if they would do that for everyone. If not, just keep your old EZ squeeze bottle or find a nice dropper bottle that will do the job without making a mess. Oh and finding the powder wasn't easy. It is not an option on their home/default web page. I had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder."

Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I ordered it, which taught me a lesson. The picture showed beautiful, purple flowers...when mine arrived, it barely had any leaves, let alone flowers! Also, the instructions that came with the ""plant"" said it was for outdoors, & there was nothing about that in the description.

For some reason there was a very strong bran-like taste as the most dominant flavor, with sweet and chocolate as the secondary and tertiary flavors in that order. I assume it was from the brown rice. I agree with another reviewer that they are very sweet, though since I cooked them in mini cupcake form it was not a significant problem for me. I tried for several weeks (including refrigerating and freezing) to try and finish them without wasting them, but I finally gave up. I was so worried I gave away my other untried products (carrot cake mix etc.) from this company. I didn't dare try the rest, as brown rice was listed as a primary ingredient again."

This product deserves about a negative 10 star designation.  It is not organic (one reviewer described finding it in the ""organic"" section of their local grocery store).

Please be aware that ""Bear Naked"" is not some folksy brand - it is a subsidiary of Kelloggs...the same Kelloggs that has donated substantial amounts of money to defeat a California November 6th Right-to-Know Ballot Initiative (Proposition 37) that would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods and would, in the words of the Organic Consumers Organization put ""an end to the unethical practice, unfortunately common even in the alternative food sector, of marketing or labeling GMO-tainted food as ""natural.""<br /><br />The group GMO Free USA, has launched campaign #1: Boycott Kelloggs, noting ""In this digital age, you have to wonder why a company would spend more money than it could possibly cost to change their product labels to fight against the consumer's right to know what we are eating.""<br /><br />Why, they might even have to label a seemingly ""clean"" brand like Bear Naked with the truth...and then how much of this phony product would they sell?

I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me.  This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others.  I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack.  First off, the package says low fat.  They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come.  Next, the chip has no snap too it.  It is soft and melts.  Not something you want in a chip.  Worst of all is the taste.  The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty.  Overall, avoid this product.

I have a strong aversion to Sweet n Low because of what is for me a most unpleasant aftertaste, but I know that some people enjoy it.  Splenda and Equal have very little aftertaste for me, and blended in with other ingredients, I cannot detect any unpleasant taste from either, although I have friends who cannot stand to use them. Many years ago, I bought liquid Stevia sweetener, but the aftertaste, which to me had an anise flavor, was a turn-off. In the quest for a healthier sweetener, I decided to purchase a small box of Truvia, thinking that the powdered form might be more inviting.  Instead, it has the same disgusting bitter aftertaste that I remember from Sweet n Low. But like that sweetener, many people seem to enjoy Truvia and other Stevia products. If you aren't able to try just a sample of Truvia and therefore are considering spending your hard-earned cash on an entire box, then be aware before you buy that you may have taste buds like mine that can detect bitterness in this product."

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."

B0000TSQ6G,A1YY8E73IHAK6,Cheryl M. Waugh,8,12,1,2010-09-19,Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb."
B000M5U6CU,AKZKG2Z7CNV27,BreezyPaige,1,1,1,2012-03-27,Terrible cat food,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn."

Otherwise, look for a less expensive short grain brown rice because it will have the same health benefits for you and let you buy more with your money.<br />Basically, it's just rice and it is overpriced (suggest you search your local chinese markets or grocery stores a little harder for short grain brown rice, or find one with a better shipping cost)."

They tasted like their about to go stale. I tried a different flavor just to double check and though it tasted alittle better it was also tasted like it was close to its expiration date. I gave it to some friends to try because taste is a personal preference. They told me that it didn't taste as fresh and was alittle stale. A friend referred me to this brand of chips.

It showed up as ""Dark Hot"" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says ""Dark Chocolate"" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside."

Johnson,4,13,1,2011-10-01,Saturated Fat Nightmare,"With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets."

Zante raisins (Vitis vinifera) are fine as raisins go, but they are not the antioxidant powerhouses that real currants are, and they do not have the complex flavor that the rest of the world associates with black currants.

B003QNJYXM,A3FLSVG6X28O1H,S. Newstone,16,31,1,2009-07-02,Quite possibly the worst product I have ever purchased in my life,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned."
B004E4CCSQ,A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,Angela Evans,0,0,1,2012-02-12,not good,"I like water but sometimes I need a little bit of flavor diversity.  I tend to turn to Crystal Light or my water infuser to vary my drink selection.  I was excited to try the MIO Liquid.  MIO seemed like an easy way to make a beverage that had the perfect amount of flavoring.  Unfortunately, I found this beverage to be lacking.<br /><br />Some notes on this product:<br /><br />Flavor: Do you like jello?  That is what I felt like I was drinking.  The liquefied version of some jello that I would not classify as peach or tea inspired. It tasted highly artificial and would not be a beverage that I would offer to a family member or friend to quench their thirst on a hot day.<br /><br />Color: The color was orange.  It did not resemble tea and had the appearance of jello.<br /><br />Ease of use:  I found this product to be burdensome.  It is messy and I would never let a young child use this product.  The product cannot be squirted at even a slight angle because it will splatter - clothes, the floor, hands - and stain.  I was so disgusted when I first used this product and some of the product splattered onto my white vinyl floor and left huge stains.  I had to scrub the floor multiple times for the MIO stains to fade.<br /><br />Health impact:  I tried drinking this stuff twice and on both occasions I developed headaches.  I do develop migraines after consumption of certain foods and beverages but usually the food/beverage culprits contain caffeine or chocolate.<br /><br />Packaging: MIO is packaged in a #7 plastic. #7 plastics are the most difficult type of plastic to recycle. Unless you live in a really progressive place that accepts #7 plastics, the product packaging will have to be pitched.<br /><br />In sum, I cannot recommend MIO.  The product stains flooring, does not taste like tea, possibly causes headaches, and is packaged in a plastic that is difficult to recycle.<br /><br />.000001 stars out of 5"

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes.

I opened my water bottle. It doesn't say you cannot do this, in fact on the bottle itself it does show 2 kinds of water bottles, both with their tops off.<br /><br />Then the liquid squirts out of the bottle, onto my counter, which by the way you will need Soft Scrub or some kind of cleanser to get the liquid off of your counter, because it will NOT just wash off with a sponge, because I tried that first.  It did NOT work! The stain was still there, before I used the Soft Scrub to remove the stain.  Good thing it did work, because Iam a renter, and it left a huge stain!  Why this enery drink would even leave a stain that cannot just be wiped up with wet sponge is a mystery to me, which also makes me question what could be in this drink to make it even do that? That's the big question!<br /><br />The liquid squirted out onto this dish that I keep on my counter which I use for fruit, bread, etc.  Needless to say, the liquid was on the dish, and got into the bread/plastic, so I had to throw that away too.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor.  It's terrible!  It tastes fake,artifical,leaves a weird taste in your mouth, kind of like Hawaiian Punch, but worse!  Good thing I did not use alot of it in my water bottle!

In ayurvedic terms, this is not Sathwic for one's body.<br /><br />  We totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats. We ordered six cases of the ginger. They use no onion or garlic in any of their products. Most companies do list ""spices"" but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately. This company who makes the primal strips does not. After all the comparisons, we found tasty eats soy jerky to be the best taste, quality and texture.<br /><br />  In fact, they are out of Teriyaki, their best selling jerky, the original flavor, peppered and hot n' spicy.

Anyway, the gift came with this 4 pack of coffee cans. I truly wanted to love this coffee but it has been very hard to do so. By using a moka pot you can control almost every aspect of the brewing process. I have tried literally a hundred tweaks and changes in brewing technique but none of them can mask the terrible taste this coffee will leave in your mouth. I can only describe it experience as unpleasant as drinking coffee after using mouthwash except thats the experience after every sip. It isn't a mint taste its more like a bitter licorice that is extracted in the essence (the first stuff to come out tof the spout and yes I even tried separating the first part from the rest of the cup and the horrid taste is in the first part). I tried opening other cans but the experience was the same. I would give this stuff 0 stars except the company produces a very nice grind that minimizes any sediment (mud) in my cup, so for that I give it 1 star.<br /><br />I really wanted to like the brand so I went to my local supermarket and picked up the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0D8"">Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4)</a> and all I can say is wow.

It is no more meaningful than it would be to write ""100% nightshade free"" on the container. See the comment thread under Matt's review for more information. 2-star penalty for misleading advertising.<br /><br />2) This cocoa tastes no better than cheaper brands I've tried, and it is more expensive other brands that taste better. 3 stars for taste.<br /><br />3) The fat-free aspect is not very significant, at least not to me. Cocoa powder is roughly 20% fat, but you only need a small amount of cocoa powder to make hot chocolate.<br /><br />4) The metal containers, while nice looking, do not function well.

I don't know why the sticks from the bag I sampled were evenly sized and smelled fine and this order was so different.  I will look elsewhere for bully sticks from now on as I need to be able to depend on the quality of the product.  My friend also ordered a bag with the same poor results and won't be buying from this company again either."

I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is ""NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME"". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues."

B000E46GSW,A2VWZR0ETK5RHN,west,18,33,1,2010-12-10,This is trash. This is not food.,"Check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the Amazon page.<br /><br />Is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word Omega somewhere and think that it's necessarily good for them? Nature's Path does not tell us which Omega 6s or Omega 3s it contains. Beneficial Omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax. Omega 6s are generally what we get from corn-fed stockyard beef. Or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil.<br /><br />Note that this product contains 900 mg of Omega 6s and 400 mg of Omega 3s. More than twice as much of Omega 6s as Omega 3s. The typical, god-awful American diet contains a ratio of 20:l Omega 6s to Omega 3s. Nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3:1 ration of Omega 3s to Omega 6s.<br /><br />Large studies are indicating that Omega 3s help the cardiovascular system, reduce inflammation, may have a helpful role in preventing cancer, improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias. Are these studies far enough along to be conclusive? No. Are they pointing us in some healthy directions?  Yes.  Are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies, but human studies?  Yes.<br /><br />The most positive results so far indicate that Omega 3s are very good for our hearts.<br /><br />So, you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola, flax seed, raisins, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds. What are they using these fiber-rich foods for? The box?<br /><br />You also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - FOURTEEN - grams! of sugar, along with some saturated fat.<br /><br />I've been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and I'm shocked to see that there is NO  nutritional value in any of the bars produced by Nature's Path Organic. I decided to check out Nature's Path cereals, etc., and found the same garbage.<br /><br />The words organic, nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies, but this is the most egregious example I've seen in a while. I'd like to see Amazon pull these products - if we stop buying them and the market disappears - so will the products. In the meantime, we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn. We need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores, supermarkets, food banks and places we go when we can't to get to or afford our co-op. We need to keep ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy, well-nourished and strong.<br /><br />Best to all."

I saw this at the grocery store and was so excited that I bought two bottles. I bought lots of vegetables and good jasmine rice to go with it. As soon as I opened the bottle I tasted a little with my finger. I wanted to be sick. It's sour like sour milk. I was cooking for two other people though so I tried to make the best of it. I added two whole cans of coconut milk, an entire handful of basil and another of cilantro, chicken flavoring, sambal oelek, sugar, salt, anything I thought would help. It ended up edible somehow, but I couldn't eat much because I still had the horrible taste in my mouth.

When I scraped it off into the sink, it just stayed in one clump and wouldn't even rinse down the sink very easily (like you'd expect from butter).  And even if you like the taste of a bunch of butter on your cake, save yourself some money.  The only ingredients in this mix are powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt.  You can buy all those very cheaply and still add all the butter the directions call for (2.5 sticks!).  Gross!"

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."

As he's getting older, I thought I'd go for the LITE since I'm sure regular Greenies have a lot higher calories.  So I bought Greenies LITE (teenie, 96 pack) and he sniffed at the first one and literally pushed it away with his nose and several more attempts have gone unsuccessful and I've been just handing them out to my friends' less-picky dogs.  Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.  So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular."

In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The ""lime"" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer."

B001BM4RC8,AFBAML6LS05KB,Stephanie L. Cobb,9,11,1,2009-10-22,"If you want fiber, don't buy!","I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips.

However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation.

I have totally accepted the fact that GF foods are just going to taste/feel different than<br />'regular"" foods, but these were just so terrible. Not only was the texture very grainy and un-fluffy there was a very strange under-flavor. I always add just a drop of vanilla to my pancake mixes, so naturally I did with this too. When I tasted them, I thought I must have accidentally put half the bottle of vanilla in, before I realized that it wasn't quite the vanilla that made them taste so bad. I smelled the pancake mix, and discovered that the mix itself has a very floral-y or perfume-y scent to it. I have never used a pancake mix where the mix itself was scented. This was very strange to me, and I was just disgusted by the outcome, so I will keep searching for the perfect mix."

I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better. There are bitter notes to this sauce which I attribute to chile seeds, vinegar and an excessive amount of salt. Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.<br /><br />I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.<br /><br />This is a fine company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.<br /><br />The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar.

B001AS1A4Q,A3FLSVG6X28O1H,S. Newstone,16,31,1,2009-07-02,Quite possibly the worst product I have ever purchased in my life,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned."

B0002TJB04,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,7,11,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be ""sugar free"", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need ""special"" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you.

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet."

The Lea & Perrins that is sold in the US now uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar (which is what is still in the UK version.)

A pity because it must mean only a cent or so difference in the manufacturing cost.

I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.<br /><br />Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style.

B003QNJYXM,A15L84NVZAZGNX,Robert,4,4,1,2012-07-02,Serious Side Effects,"During a scooter tour of the southwest (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizon), a group of us decided to try one of the 5 hour energy drinks (I think I had the Berry 1.93 ounce, regular strength).  I have to say that I was one of the unfortunate few folks who experienced side effects so dramatic (extreme heart rhythm interruption, loss of vision, numbness in the arms and hands, etc.) that I will never try one of these drinks ever again.  The impacts to my heart (I typically have great blood pressure and heart rate from years of exercise and road bike racing/riding) were so over the top that I had no patterned rhythm and I ended up in the emergency room after passing out from a huge drop in blood pressure.  My vision became blurry and eventually tunneled, and the EMT squad who responded to the 911 call (we initially thought I was having a heart attack) could not get any regular heart beat for about 15 minutes (and this took four baby aspirin and a nitro pill).<br /><br />Interestingly enough, other members of our group who also tried the 5 hour energy drink experienced a nice rush of energy and felt great, others in the group basically stated that the mixture tasted like dirty water and had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I guess this basically tells me that the ingredients (at least for this brand of energy drink supplement) really react differently for everyone.  I did notice that the drink provides a warning about not consuming more than two in a specific period of time.  For me at least, the bad reaction was enough to warn me away from trying these ever again."

Despite the price difference, both listings appear to be for the same item and are sold by the same Indian Grocery.  From reading the other reviews, it is clear that at least one other customer had the same bad experience as I did.<br /><br />I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT ""foil-wrapped for freshness"" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).  I returned both boxes of tea and hope to get an Amazon refund soon.  I am very bummed."

Now the Nesquik people want to make efforts for new customers by making it 25% less sugar; and I say, does it matter to most kids?  It tastes horrible still!

B000BQVS0E,A119RW19UWK7PH,"Sylver ""Emergency Nurse""",3,6,1,2011-12-26,NOT a replacement for milk!!,"As a nurse practitioner, I've learned a lot about infant and child nutrition. First, you must understand that children under age 2 NEED fats for their brains to develop. Brain matter is mostly fat. If babies and toddlers don't get enough fat, their neurological development will be impaired. Human breast milk is mostly fat (about 50% of calories); while the other half is milk sugars (lactose). Protein is actually a very small part of human milk. Nature naturally has saturated fats & cholesterol in mother's milk for infant mammals, as well as the yolk of egg for baby chicks. In other words, fats, particularly saturated fat and cholesterol are very necessary and healthy for a rapidly growing infant body and brain. That is why FULL FAT dairy is recommended by all doctors for every child under the age of 2.<br />Anyways, in reviewing the nutritional data on this drink, it is very low in calories, especially fat calories. I'd be concerned if parents tried to replace dairy with this drink. A child's brain and development could negatively be affected by not having enough fat. Plus a child would not get enough calories with this drink.<br />Most other countries in the world use milk for their children- not necessarily cow's milk though. I've breastfed my daughter for 1 year, and have now switched her over to goat's milk, which is recommended for children who have milk intolerances or sensitivities. The fats and proteins in goats milk are more broken down, making it easier to digest than cow's milk. If you are looking for a healthy alternative to cow's milk, I'd recommend goat's milk much more over this ""rice drink""."

First, he is correct that the tea itself does not look at all like the image on the webpage (it doesn't consist of what looks like rolled leaves, but rather is in tiny flakes).  Most importantly, he is right about the flavor.  There is practically none; and the flavor that is there is stale, dull.  It is the most insipid green tea I have ever drunk (and I have drunk many kinds, from China, Japan, Sri Lanka, etc.); but in light of the off-putting nature of the flavor, I was actually glad there was not more of it.

She kept begging for food, but I would each time point out that she had food in her dish.  She finally ate it, reluctantly, the next evening and then was up all night vomiting. The next day we smelled a dead animal odor that we couldn't locate. Sugar (the dog) sniffed it out for us at the top of the cabinet and we discovered that at least one of the Pedigree cans had burst open and was full of squirming white worms and rotting, oozing liquid that permeated the entire package.

The instructions further state to ""discard the container"" after opening, so I was not sure it would even be safe to store my leftover portion in it. Turns out I didn't need to worry about it, because the soup itself was certainly nothing special! Same old salty-yet-bland canned soup garbage that ALWAYS disappoints. I ate about 1/3 out of the bowl hunger, then dumped the rest once I felt like I could make it through to dinnertime.<br /><br />I had bought several of these in preparation for returning to work after maternity leave because they seemed like a nice, convenient cold-weather lunch option.

I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.

I was extremely disappointed to find that, instead of a 'Use Before' date of 2 or 3 years, as I have always found on UHT milk bought in other countries, the expiry date on this product, bought in August 2011, is February 2012. This means I will have to repurchase the milk every 6 months, making it much too expensive.<br /><br />It is maddening that buying the item on-line one cannot check (or ask about) the 'Use Before' date.  I would of course check this if I could buy the milk in a store. This reminds one once again of the disadvantages of shopping on-line, with no recourse to asking questions of a person and getting essential information which affects the choice to purchase.<br /><br />I do feel that sellers on UHT milk should give their customers the LONG LIFE product they expect."

Imagine my surprise when I opened the box to find ONE box (1.5 ounce, 6 servings) instead of the expected 24.  This leads to a call to Amazon with a customer service representative who unfortunately didn't know what Jell-O pudding was and was having a hard time understanding that there had been an error in the number of items shipped.  Ummmm...<br />who would pay $30 for six 1/2 cup servings of pudding???  This was finally understood and another order was placed (kindly, they did not require me to return the single box of pudding).  Low and behold, several days later the package arrives... AGAIN another single box of pudding instead of a case of 24 boxes.  Another phone call to Amazon, another rep who doesn't quite understand but finally decides to just credit me for the order and not require that I return the single package.  It was decided that we would not try to place the order again, as it would appear the warehouse has a problem filling orders for this item.  I orderd the chocolate flavor case of 24 and it arrived without problem... a carton of 24 boxes of pudding mix, as expected."

I bought a 5-pack of this Paneer Makahani, and it's just disgusting. I am very passionate about Indian cooking, and cook Indian food at least 4 times a week (and am an Indian myself). Firstly, MTR seems to use the exact same sauce base for all the curries (I bought the Mixed Vegetables and it has the same revolting flavor base), and the sauce is just not right! If you tell me that it has Indian flavors, I won't disagree with you. But Indian spices need to be used better - they must be matured properly by cooking them off in hot oil, adding aromatics in the right amounts, etc. The paneer was absolutely bad quality and tasted like rubber, the pieces were minuscule and lost in the river of bland, disgusting sauce. Paneer Makhani is one of the most beautiful north Indian dishes, with a nice and smooth, creamy tomato-based sauce, and a base of tandoori but mild spices. This one is grainy, the sauce is pungent, and it's just disgusting to be brief.

However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know ""garbage in, garbage out!""<br /><br />Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based.<br /><br />Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet.<br /><br />If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world.<br /><br />My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health.<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats.<br /><br />Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/17/11<br /><br />For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning.  Kibble is only 10% moisture content.  If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like.  The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses.  Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume.  If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines.  This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem.  So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture.<br /><br />In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine.  This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues.<br /><br />UPDATE:  8/27/12<br /><br />My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind.  He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet.<br /><br />For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats.  I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history.  There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat.  Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat.  The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food.  The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats.<br /><br />I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so.  The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food.  Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition.  Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue.  However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product.  This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself.<br /><br />As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes.  At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations.  When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix.  The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health.  Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product.<br /><br />So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix."

I don't think it was due to coffee bean direct or that the beans were old.  I actually believe them to be pretty freshly roasted.  The coffee bean itself I think was subpar to begin with.  It was like someone took all of the beautiful aromatic notes out of the coffee and left me with an old balsam like note (Kind of like the smell of a cheap cigar).  The taste was bearable once I put some chicory in, but without it I didn't want to drink it.<br />If you want to buy 5lbs of coffee please stick with one you can trust.

Racoon(s) began raiding the nests.  I bought the pellets and the spray.  Scattered a whole box of pellets around the ground where I still had active bird nests a couple of weeks ago.  I used the spray just yesterday on the ground around these nests and sprayed the steel posts the Nest Boxes are attached to.  This morning I checked the closest Tree Swallow nest to my house and sure enough a Racoon had a late night dinner of the two baby Tree Swallows inhabiting the nest and the nest was all torn up.

This new 70% bar should not be considered chocolate and Lindt should be embarrassed for selling it with their name attached. I bought three bars of the original before the stock was replaced with the dreaded new recipe. Too bad chocolate doesn't keep well, I would have bought a box! If you like dark, coco tasting chocolate and are not fond of greasy tasteless bars that call themselves chocolate...don't waste your money on the new recipe. I hope Lindt gets the message and brings back the ORIGINAL recipe!"

But since the price went up from $23 for a twin pack to $32 in 2011, I started to look for cheaper alternatives.  I ordered the Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso, 2.2-pounds Box (Pack of 150) and I really love it! The freshly brewed creme is really nice and foamy!!Yum! After finishing the whole box in less than 2 month, I wanted to try something different.  Caffe d'arte firenze to me is very potent and astringent and almost too earthy (in other words, it tastes like dirt). Price is higher than Lavazza Grand Crema i.e. $0.35 a pop compared to $0.24 for Lavazza if you subscribed it. Even worse, this is a ""non-refundable product"" so I have to stick with it for a while :("

There also is no ""organic"" label on the bag aside from a shoddily printed sticker that says ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Because of all of this I can not be sure this product is not adulterated, let alone organic. I will not purchase this product again from this seller and suggest that other buyers beware. The product itself may be fine, but why take a chance (especially if you are looking for what is supposed to be an 'organic' product free of contaminants)?<br /><br />UPDATE 4/12/12:<br />I complained about the improper packaging and submitted photo evidence of the static shield bags to both the seller and Amazon. Originally the seller claimed the product was shipped in food-grade ULINE bags, but after I sent photo evidence to the contrary I heard nothing further from the seller.

All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.

He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as ""illegal"" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that ""coca leaf"" is a schedule II substance and illegal.  http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_12.htm.<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.<br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com."

B003MWBFXY,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,7,9,1,2010-12-04,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box.

But, like certain kinds of salt, or olive oil, or vinegar, it is a ""finishing"" product, one that should be added at the very end for that final flavor spike, just before plating.<br /><br />My advice would be to buy a higher quality product, and use it sparingly- with truffle oil, a little goes a long way. (But with this product, the flavor was weak and flat- I couldn't get that heady 'truffle punch"", as I call it, no matter how much I wasted.)<br /><br />I recommend S.

Amy's Southwestern chili is one of these items - it apparently contains ""spices,"" but Amy's does not respect consumers enough to reveal exactly what those spices are. If you tell Amy's customer service what you cannot have, they will tell you if that particular ingredient is in the mix, but the problem with this of course is that many people have multiple food sensitivities, with varying responses (for instance, the same person may go into anaphylaxis from nuts, get slight hives from citrus, and get the shakes from caffeine or chocolate), and they need to know exactly what is in the food they eat so that if and when they do have an allergic reaction they can figure out what specific ingredient was the culprit and avoid it in the future. If you invite a friend with allergies over to your house and they ask what you put in their food, who in their right mind would make that person play a guessing game to figure out whether they will be poisoned by the food or not?<br /><br />It's a matter of respect, and on this count Amy's has fallen flat on its face. I urge you to avoid all of Amy's products that list vague ingredients, like ""spices"" or ""natural flavors."" Hopefully they will eventually get the hint."
