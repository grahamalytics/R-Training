I bought my Vinturi last February and cannot drink wine without using it.

My Vinturi is held in one hand while pouring into a flask or glass. I do not drink white wine, but my wife says Vinturi aeration improves white wine as well.

I use it to make dressings, add it to deviled eggs, glazes, and sauces.  It's a staple in many dishes.  Generic, inexpensive balsamic is okay to use for some purposes, but gourmet balsamic is best for reductions.  I tried using an inferior vinegar to make a reduction sauce as a dessert, and it didn't turn out.  Fattoria not only gives a stronger flavor to salad dressings, but reductions taste rich and sweet."

I've yet to eat it as a cereal for breakfast, though. I just pop open the bag and eat it by the handful as a snack. Not too sweet, just enough to taste good. I was recently disappointed in the Vanilla Almond Crunch variety, it tasted too strongly of oil to me. The banana nut has never disappointed. I recommend that you find it locally if you can, to try the flavors, then come to Amazon to buy the ones you like best. The price here is almost $1 off per bag compared to Target."

If you pour a jigger thru the device try it.  Then try a tiny amount not passed thru.  You will be amazed!!!  Worth every penny.  Especially for that guy who thinks he has everything and also knows it all.  I promise he will learn something is indeed new under the sun. A word of warning.  This device MUST be washed after every use otherwise it sticks closed and does not work!  But, it is well worth the extra effort. The comments about the device sticking closed are true and therefore it must be washed with clear water after each use."

It was a surprise to find them on Amazon. They arrived quickly and amazingly fresh and uncrumbled. This is a feat because their texture is very crisp and crumbly. They are somewhere between a not very sweet cookie and a salty cracker, thicker than a regular cracker with an almost shortbread quality. They have a deliciously satisfying nutty whole meal flavor. I have one for breakfast every day with a thin slice of low fat cheddar on top. My husband has one or two as an after dinner treat."

B001EQ4QL8,A3CAVQ5VYWV2OP,R. Smigelski,1,1,5,2010-07-28,Pepperiffic !!,The Durkee Spices really are great. The crushed red pepper has an almost roasted aroma and taste. The heat is just about perfect. Used some as soon as I received it. I made hot mustard with it instead of grinding up peppers. Worked great !!<br /><br />Also with Durkee you know when the spices have been packed by the date code. Many others do not bother to put one on their packages.
B000FEDHHE,AXVSXG0TVQB4T,M. A. Leahy,3,3,5,2009-12-19,the best ever,"Even on a modified gluten-free diet these are permitted for me.  They have a slight buttery taste which makes them appealiing for all types of appetizers or snacks; they are especially good with a spread, like Nutella.  They always arrive unbroken because they are so well packed and they are consistently fresh. There are a variety of uses for these, from snacks to saads to main dishes--they are kid friendly also because of the great taste.  Pricing is better than through grocery store."
B000M6CTZG,A3UABEVLBMEYXR,J. Healy,2,2,5,2011-06-11,Delicious and nutritious,"A very slight bitter taste blends beautifully with the sweetness in this honey.

The texture is rich with the variety of several grains, and the flavor is a delightful combination of the grains and a touch of honey.  These are my favorite TLC crackers, but I switch out with the other varieties regularly."
B0013NUGDE,A44OY8EFDM4IP,"Tiffany A. Harkleroad ""Tiffanys Bookshelf""",0,1,5,2012-01-28,I loved them!,"I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation."

I love that they can be tossed in a gym bag or purse and won't be smashed at the end of the day.  Sure, a whole apple might be a little better for you, but these sure beat other snacks if you are looking for a little chewy, tart snack."
B001SAO0HU,AY12DBB0U420B,Gary Peterson,0,0,5,2012-03-27,"Excellent Taste, High in Calories.","I picked up a bottle of Kedem Grape Juice (concord) at my local Fresh and Easy Market. I thought it was one of their concentrates, but when I got it home I found out it was just grape juice. That's okay, it was quite excellent concord grape juice, one of the best I've tried. Fine flavor. Delicious. It''s quite sweet, but it has no added sugar or any artificial sweeteners. My problem with it, which may not apply to other people, is that it's too high in calories (150 per 7-oz. serving). I can partly get around this by diluting it with a slightly carbonated water, but this dilutes the delicious flavor also. In any case, it's an excellent product and I highly endorse it if you can stand the high caloric content.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
B000ENUC3S,ABKP2O7MIVSVT,K. Kilmartin,5,5,5,2006-10-19,a life saver for those on a gluten-free diet,"recently diagnosed with celiac, I've had to restructure my whole vision of food and snacks and how to stay healthy.  I've never had luck with nutrition/meal replacement bars in the past (can we say cardboard?), so I was leery when those on the celiac support boards kept singing the praises of Larabars.<br /><br />I picked up my first one at Whole Foods, and was worried with the high nut content -- I'm not known to be fond of nuts.  but after one bite, I discovered I LOVE nuts -- if they are in a Larabar.  the cherry bars are sweet and sure at the same time, just like fresh cherries.  the dates and nuts balance out the flavor experience.<br /><br />unlike other bars, these are soft and tasty, and beyond filling!  I can usually only nibble half at a time.  but now, I have something to keep in my purse or in my desk at work for emergency food.  everyone else can have a sandwich with their wheat filled bread, and I'm perfectly happy to munch away on my Larabar."
B000FI4O90,A3LDQM3GCURG92,"NuJoi ""Create with me""",233,238,5,2006-07-06,Why Didn't Someone Think of This Sooner??!!,"I love this product -- no dirt, no bugs and no chance of over-watering!  This is very easy to assemble and easy to use.  Just add water and a couple of nutrient tablets every two weeks.  There's even a light that tells you when you need to do this.<br /><br />I planted my Gourmet Herbs on June 15 and I was ready to harvest the basil before the fourth of July!  If you follow the instructions, there's no way to mess this up. The herbs lasted about six months. My only caution is (and this is noted in the instruction booklet) that the lamps are on about 16 hours a day and they are bright at night.  I can close off the bedrooms, so it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone one who has tried to grow herbs indoors in the past.  Aerogarden's customer service team is the best -- they know their stuff and are vary helpful.  I had a problem with one of the herb kits and they have really worked to fix the problem.<br /><br />Update:  I read another reviewer's note about installing a new pump.  I had a seed pod that never sprouted and after being shipped a replacement pod that also didn't work, Aerogarden sent me a new pump.  I installed it last night with a new kit.  The instructions were clear and it was pretty easy to do.  I liked doing it myself in five minutes instead of sending the unit somewhere to be repaired.  It still was an inconvenience, but my positive experiences with the product far outweigh the annoyance of the installation.<br /><br />Update:<br />My first kit was the gourmet herb and as noted above, I had problems with the cilantro.  I have since replanted my garden by mixing the French, Itallian and new Gourmet Herb kits and they've worked beautifully,especially the cilantro.  The new pump has made all the difference.  My oregano is even more hearty this time around.  With the mew pump, all of my herbs are doing better.  After almost two months of growth, the thyme appears to be the least robust of the bunch, but still has a good yield. It's in a back corner spot."

We tried several different ones and Tart Is Smart Tart Cherry Concentrate has been the one that has given us the most positive results. We mix it 2 Tablespoons to a cup of water and drink it once a day.  (It tastes good too which is a plus!)  On the rare occasion that we miss a day, we are well aware of it because our joints hurt more on those days.  Through Amazon.com, we get it shipped automatically [on a personalized] schedule which makes the price even more affordable but even without that added bonus, the price is very reasonable.

I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from."

I've recently become a huge pu-erh fan, so I've been on the lookout for great pu-erh that won't cost me a leg. I keep hearing that tuos don't usually have great quality, that often tea dust and poor quality leaves are compressed to make the ""nests"" (and yes, I've tasted those often enough to say it's true), but that's not the case here. In fact, this has become one of my favorite pu-erhs. (I've also tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021I8F60"">Rishi Tea Pu-erh Classic, 3.2-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)</a>, which I thought was bound to be better simply because it was loose leaf, but that is not the case. I was not impressed... this one is much tastier.)<br /><br />I can get 3 huge mugs (each with a strong brew) out of 1 little tuo. The 4th one is already too watery, but the 3rd is still as strong as I like. This tea made me understand those comments about good pu-erh being ""a mouthful"", thick (I used to wonder what on earth it meant); it is like gulping milk, very interesting experience. I can't really describe the flavor, except to say that it's mellow, sweet, and very yummy. As all pu-erhs, it never gets bitter. To make this taste like heaven, I sometimes add a little bit of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N749GY"">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, Loose Leaf Tea, 16 Ounce Bag</a> for some chocolate/vanilla/orange flavor - perfection in a cup!!!<br /><br />I was wondering how many tuos actually fit into one of these little tins... and the answer is, quite a lot of them! That was another good surprise."

It tastes just like water... probably closer to Dasani than to Poland Spring, and nothing like Evian (not surprising, since the label indicates they use reverse osmosis to do the purification, which is what Dasani does).<br /><br />Most surprisingly, there really is something to the ""silky smooth taste,"" it's not purely marketing.  Whether from the high pH or something else, this is just good water.  (That said, I don't necessarily feel better hydrated than I would with regular water.)<br /><br />Regarding the health claims of alkali water, YMMV.  To their credit, Essentia doesn't really make any of the claims on the bottle, but Google them or look them up on other products here on Amazon.  Some people are hard core believers, some think they're bunk.  I am not really qualified to give a real scientific judgement on them, but I started looking into alkaline water after reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470913029"">The Paleo Diet: Lose Weight and Get Healthy by Eating the Foods You Were Designed to Eat</a>.  There's an interesting rant in the book about the acid/base balance in the body (in short, the contention is that lots of grains lead to the body being to acidic and an acidic body is bad).  The suggestion there is basically to eat lots of vegetables, but my immediate thought was ""why not just drink alkaline water?""  I have no idea of the answer.<br /><br />If you're curious, the plastic bottle is a PETE 1.  Also, these are 1.5 Litre bottles, which are quite big."

It came with a container of frosting that we heated up and drizzled over the top of it. I had a little extra frosting that I used to thickly coat one piece upon my husband's request for extra frosting since that was his favorite part. I love how the bundt cake has the design that I could cut smaller or larger pieces.  The cake was so rich that a little went a long way.

So far, I've tried all variations of the Country Cut.  Barbecue and Teriyaki are sweet and true to their flavors.  Honey Pepper is fairly sweet with that black pepper kick all over it.  Mild is exactly as it says, mild(it would be like Spicy with no spicy hehe).  Chipotle Habanero, though, is a whole different story.  It is VERY spicy and the burn will stay in your mouth for a while longer as expected so be careful.  Compared to buying Jack Link's for half the price(and almost half the flavor IMO), this is really good deal."

Since it's thinner than regular spaghetti, the rice taste (or lack of taste) isn't noticeable - no one I've served this to has ever seemed to notice it isn't wheat spaghetti.  The other real plus, for me, is how quickly it cooks - 4 to 6 minutes instead of the over 15 minutes so many other GF spaghettis require.  Granted, the thicker spaghettis have their place too - in soups, where I do prefer them to the thinner vermicelli.  But for eating as spaghetti, Ener-G's vermicelli remains my first and only choice.<br /><br />Just one problem: Instructions on the last bags I received say to cook for 14 minutes.  Good grief.  These cook in about 4 minutes, and need to be placed under running water immediately or all you get is mush.  I'm not using them as much as I did - have switched to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IAIOS"">Annie Chun's Brown Rice Noodle, Pad Thai, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> as my favorite spaghetti substitute.

I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way."

I was buying the Campbell's Healthy Request Minestrone, which has just a little more sodium then this, and the difference is quite noticeable. But the texture of Amy's is not as watery, more like home made(although nothing's like homemade) and the veggies seem more like real veggies then Campbell's. It is packed with veggies and has a good portion of pasta as well, and with a little bread(low sodium/whole grain) it makes a great lunch.There are 2 servings per can, and the servings are a pretty generous size.<br /><br />There are other benefits to this soup beside the low-sodium.It is really nutritious. It is made with al Vegan/Organic ingredients,is very low fat, has NO cholesterol, and you just heat and serve.It's a good source of Vitamins A and C, and has some iron benefit as well. Unlike the condensed soups, no water is added. Also it is marked as Kosher.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Filtered Water,Organic Tomatoes,Organic Onions,Organic Carrots,organic Kidney Beans,Organic Potatoes,Organic Celery,organic Pasta(organic semolina flour),Organic Green Beans,Organic Peas,Organic Leeks,pure herbs and spices,Organic High Oleic Safflower and/or sunflower oil,Sea`Salt,Organic Garlic. It DOES contain Wheat(for those with allergies). The facility also processes milk, soy,tree nuts and seed products, however does not use any peanuts,fish,shellfish or eggs -(all from label)<br /><br />sodium per serving is 290mg,dietary fiber is 3 gm,sugar 5g and protein 3 g. total fat is 1.5g(no trans or saturated fat and carbs are 17g.<br /><br />I also think this 12 pack case is a really good buy. Even if you tried to make homemade soup-have you looked at the price of organic veggies these days.And don't think you will get bored with this, the case I received has a shelf life through jan 2011, so it's not like you have to eat it up all at once(but it is pretty good!) And by the way, my order shipped and arrived promptly.<br /><br />So remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy.........Laurie"

In this book there is a recipe for Honey Almond Butter Spread that has raw almond butter as an ingredient. You mix the almond butter with honey and cardamom and use it as a dip for apples. It is one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. So that is the reason I bought this almond butter and I love that it is all natural and creamy. I was worried that an almond butter would be rancid but this tasted really fresh and it has no preservative or any added anything. It is made out of raw almonds, that is it. Enjoy.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
B008J1HO4C,A12H5EJ2WNBN2K,Young,1,1,5,2012-01-18,"Ohh, ohh, oatmeal.","In an effort to eat more healthily, I bought McCANN's Steel Cut Oatmeal.  I'm sure most of you know, that steel cut oatmeal aren't rolled and boiled, so as a result, become slightly more nutritious than its rolled oat cousins.  Rolled oats are common in the instant oatmeals.  But enough of history.<br />Now, I didn't really know how much oatmeal this would yield, but one cup yields enough for 4 large servings.  As a 4-pack, I think this will probably last me a few months, easily.  Maybe the only pain is that it takes half an hour to make, but it's worth it.  The oats provide a nice bite and a slight crunch, but it's overall smooth.  Honey is always a good thing to add for quick flavor.  Fruits work just as well.  If you're feeling really adventurous, and have a brulee torch on hand, you can sprinkle the top with some sugar and proceed to brulee! And of course, you can add fruit before or after the brulee for a new dimension of flavor!<br />Bottom line, this will fill you up, and for quite a long time."

It's amazing how it goes from production to my hands in a bit over a month.  The pumpkin seeds indeed look and smell fresh.  In fact, the aroma and taste are really intense.  I'm so used to Trader Joe's and Whole Food's pumpkin seeds that are drier and probably older.  (Unfortunately, my local Trader Joe's stopped selling organic pumpkin seeds and Whole Foods is so expensive that I needed to find something more affordable.)  After I open a new bag, I leave it open to dry a bit.  We are probably losing some nutrition, but it does improve the taste while keeping them raw.<br /><br />The Amazon webpage only says, ""Processed in a facility which uses peanuts and other nuts.""  The back of the package says, ""May contain wheat, soy, tree nuts, peanuts, milk"".  The pumpkin seeds are probably processed in a facility that processes wheat, soy, and milk too."

Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!"

I usually make a 'batch' in the evening and let it sit overnight, we then have it for a few days as I find it is better as the milk absorbs.  The first time I had muesli was buffet style in a hotel overseas.  The setup was tremendous!  All types of fruit platters were at our disposal as was a bowl of yogurt and nuts.  We were encouraged to add to our delight so that is also how I often now eat it when time allows, adding a few spoonfuls of yogurt and with additions of extra raisins or craisins and cut up fruits.  While this may not be the traditional method, it provides variety, after all, all of us living in this household still have our teeth and healthy consitiutions (knock on wood) and are not in the state that this cereal was first designed to help.

He'd have LOVED this cookies. They are soft sponge biscuits with a layer of stiff orange jelly and a brittle dark chocolate topping. The combination is delectable--the soft biscuit, orangey jelly and the crackle of the bitter chocolate on top. A few of these make a great dessert with a cup of espresso. They come in raspberry flavor as well, which I tried and it's also absolutely terrific.

A cup of this tea with some honey worked so much better than popping tums in my mouth. It's very soothing to your stomach. It also helped relax me enough to be able to sleep in my 3rd trimester. There were times I would pass out even before I finished my cup. When I got sick in my 7th month, I drank this tea with the cold season one, and it worked wonders. Since it helps with clearing out your stomach, I'm assuming it also kept my weight in check as well, though I ate a lot during this pregnancy. My sister-in-law is pregnant right now, and she claims it really helps her with her indigestion as well. I highly recommend this tea."

The small counter my wife and I have our Keurig on does not have much space at all to spare. This did the trick perfectly. Likely the most sturdy, space-saving k-cup pod holder you're going to find - not to mention one of the most affordable out there. Great buy, great product, fantastic price! The medal ""piping"" and wire mesh are all sturdy and does not seem cheap or brittle in the least.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is completely insignificant and not worthy of deducing a star. At certain times the drawers tend to stick a little bit making me lightly shake the drawer a little bit in order for it to slide out. It's a completely minor thing; happens only occasionally, and definitely does not take away from the product itself, or its fantastic value!"

This is a loose tea for use in your espresso machine, stovetop espresso maker, French press or coffee maker, so it takes a little more commitment (and time) than a bagged tea, but the results were well worth the effort. For my first batch, I used a French press and the results were strong (literally and figuratively). I added some milk and sugar and enjoyed 8 ounces of red tea bliss. Although it's smooth and creamy, this is not a tea I would drink straight, but then I prefer tea and coffee loaded with milk and sugar. Next time I think I'll try making a Thai tea-type iced beverage.  If I have one complaint, it's that rooibos tea contains no caffeine, because this would be the perfect caffeine delivery system."

My first bite of one I noticed it had a hard crunch.  I like crunchy cookies, others may not.  I read here that you can leave the top opened on the bag overnight to soften them.  The cookie is about 3-4 bites worth.  On my first bite I could feel a little tongue tingle.  Each subsequent bite produced the same warm tingle and THAT is what puts this ginger snap in a class of its own, never losing that 'bite'.  It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie.  Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream.  Excellent product that I will purchase again.<br /><br />Note: Expiration date on the bags are December 17th, 2010 but I don't think they will last that long.<br /><br />--Sailor Hill, CA"

I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare."

No infection, no cold, no apparent cause. LO had been on Similac Advance since birth, and we had not changed it. His diarrhea just started out of the blue one day. We tried lactose-free, soy, organic Earth's Best, all with no results. Finally, we bought this stuff and gave it to him, hoping it would work, and it did-- instantly. The next poo he had was soft and yellow instead of brown water. Guessing it's the added fiber. The only problem is, it says on the bottle not to give it to infants under 6 months. I'm guessing that the nutritional value isn't the same as the other formulas? Also, we noticed that after 2 days of feeding him only this stuff that the tips of his poo were hardened. So now we were facing constipation. Tried half diarrhea and half advance in his next bottle and it worked like magic. His next poo was not too soft, not too hard. It's all a big experiment, and I'm slowing giving him less and less diarrhea stuff and more and more advance with each bottle. We will see how it goes."

I had some leftover cooked salmon that was crying out to be made into fishcakes; I flaked it up, mixed it with an egg, some sauteed onion, and some of these breadcrumbs, and it was just SO good! Making the breadcrumbs is rather a pain: You have to make up the mix, bake it as a loaf, cut the loaf into slices, bake those, and then whiz them up in a processor. But to be honest, it took very little time, and the only real trick was to stop eating the baked slices -- which I was tasting, you know, for quality control -- before they got turned into crumbs.

B005CIMZAS,AQ52JX9ES6XYY,Chris S.,1,1,5,2012-03-14,even better than Frappucino -- WOW!!!,"I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as others have noted, the addition of sugar (and NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451WLYI"">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a>), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even throughout the winter, this is my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I empty one bottle into a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KPH6CK"">Arc International Luminarc Working Glass, 21-Ounce, Set of 12</a> with one packet of iced VIA mix and add half-and-half and chocolate syrup, then refill the bottle with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!  Another reviewer does the same with skim milk, a great idea which would eliminate the half-and-half for a better nutritional profile.  Either way, delish!!!"

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it.

I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."

I also cook these oats with home made chicken stock...to make chicken oatmeal soup (instead of chicken noodle soup).  My boys gobble them up in no time flat.  Even my soon to be one year old loves this soup.  To kick it up a notch, add chopped broccoli during the last 5-10 min of cooking.

At 330 calories, 22 grams of fat, and 28 grams of sugar, it is still an indulgent treat, but if you choose to share the bar (as I did), you can satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling too guilty about it.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed the taste of this bar as well; I found the chocolate to be rich and smooth.  At 54% cocoa, it is definitely not as dark as many other dark chocolate offerings out there--in fact, I found the taste to be a bit sweeter, more reminiscent of semi-sweet chocolate than true dark chocolate.  Although this was fine by me, some dark chocolate lovers may be disappointed.  So, unless you need your dark chocolate to be of the extra-dark variety, I would definitely recommend this product."

I am in my mid 20s and ever since puberty, the first 1-2 days of my period were absolutely unbearable.  I would literally stay in the bathroom for hours on end in excruciating pain from cramps and terrible nausea and vomiting.  Anything I tried to eat would eventually come right back up.  I also had hot and cold sweats and light headedness.  When my symptoms finally subsided, usually 6-8 hours later, I would be completely exhausted and dehydrated.  Due to the severity of my periods, I would have to leave school, work, or any activity I was doing as I obviously couldn't be in public going through this. I know no woman likes getting her period, but I actually feared mine every single month!<br /><br />My doctor prescribed prescription strength sodium naproxen, but this did nothing to help.  Once I finished college, I decided to start taking birth control pills, at the recommendation of my doctor.  The birth control helped my pain quite a bit, but I did not like the other side effects that came with it.  After a year on the pill, I got fed up with these side effects and quit taking them.  I decided to go to my local health food store and picked up everything they had for mentrual pain, one item being the Female Toner Tea.  After one month of drinking two cups of tea a day, my menstrual cramps were so minimal I was in absolute shock/JOY! I did not have any vomiting or hot and cold sweats either!  I have been drinking this tea ever since and cannot say enough good things about how it has changed my life.  I can now get through my day when I start my period without having to suffer the terrible pain and vomitting that I endured for so many years before.  I usually take a couple Aleve for the first day when I get some uncomfortable cramping, but this is absolutely nothing compared to the type of pain I was going through before and it usually only lasts a couple hours- totally manageable.<br /><br />I wish more doctors advocated natural herbal remedies to their patients instead of automatically prescribing strong medications or hormones that are not good for our bodies.  I tell my doctor and  women who suffer from difficult mentruation about this product all the time and hope that they spread the word to give herbal a try!  I recommend this tea to any woman who is suffering from the symptoms I had before I found this product.  I have been drinking this tea for over 3 years now and it still works wonderfully for me!"

I do, however, buy a lot of sports drinks for drinking while cycling and working out.  I wasn't sure how to review plain ol' water, but I decided just to compare it with the water I get out of my faucet.  The Essentia does indeed have a better taste to it.  By comparison, my tap water has a slightly bitter taste (I'm guessing from chlorine or other chemicals added to purify it).  Essentia's water really has no taste, which is actually a good thing.  I'm not sure of the benefits its pH balance has for your body.  The addition of electrolytes does mean this product can do more for you than plain tap water if you're working out and losing a lot of water through sweat.  If you won't miss the sugary taste of a sports drink, this is a good zero-calorie alternative."

B000F7A5X0,ABLXFZDC71O7E,Rachel,2,2,5,2012-02-15,Wonder food - best food for healthy cats!,"I've always fed my cats ""good"" food, per my vet's recommendations (Royal Canin (sp) or Science Diet). But I made a crazy mistake when my cats turned 7; given Science Diet recommends a switch to a geriatric food at age 7, I changed to the geriatric formula.  BAD decision. I have Siamese cats (boy weighed 9# and girl weighed 7#) - over the course of 9 months, they each lost about a pound, which is a LOT for these little guys!  Talked to my vet and he said my cats definitely did NOT need a geriatric diet yet.  They are extremely active, as are most Orientals.<br /><br />Instead of switching back to their old Science Diet, I asked friends who did rescue work and friends who were breeders for their recommendations: they all swore by Innova Evo.  I started my cats on it and they LOVED it - and put back on the weight they lost. I also increased the amount of wet food in my cats' diet, as they previously ate predominantly dry food diet with a small amount of wet food as a treat. The change had other positives: I noticed they were vomiting less than they had in the past and my male cat, who had long suffered with allergies got better.  (This was a big deal, as he has been through extensive testing and we've tried MANY foods to help his allergies.) The only negative is that my female cat, who always had the silkiest fur, lost some of the silk and luster in her fur.  I have no idea what Science Diet puts in the food that Innova Evo doesn't have, but there was a marked change. I talked to my vet and he put both of them on Fel-V omega-3 oils, and my little girl regained most of the silkiness of her coat.<br /><br />Over time, my cats started to quit eating the Innova Evo and I experimented with some of the Innova foods with some grains, but they were only mildly interested.  My cats are finicky eaters and they get tired of the same wet food after awhile.  So, I went back to giving them many varieties of Fancy Feast (they share a 3 oz can as a dinner-time treat, as most of their diet is dry food, which they love).  They had regained the weight and were healthy.<br /><br />Jump ahead seven years.  My cats are now just shy of 15, and about six months ago, I realized my boy was losing some weight. I took him to the vet, and he checked out fine - just getting older. He still loves to eat, so I decided it was time to pack in more nutrition and calories in what he eats. Given my prior positive experience with Innova Evo, I went back to it.  My cats have again taken to it well, and my little boy has gradually regained some weight.  (Both cats remain active, racing through the house, playing, etc.) When I went to get the Innova, I was thrilled to find that there were more flavors of Innova available than I could find seven years ago (might just have been the pet store I used).  Perfect!  With the variety of flavors, I've been able to provide them some variety in their diet, while still knowing they're getting nutritious food (the regular Innova has grains, but is still a well-balanced, superior cat food, and I work the Innova Evo in as much as I can).<br /><br />When I changed my cats' wet food to Innova, I realized they also made a dry food with salmon and herring (my cats are seafood lovers, with chix as a second choice).  I got them started on the Innova dry food and they love it, too!  It's got about 3 times the protein of most ""commercial"" dry foods.<br /><br />I'm committed to ensuring my cats have long, healthy lives, and I'll be staying with Innova!  Nothing else compares (in my opinion - and I've tried a lot of foods due to my boy's allergies).  You've got nothing to lose my giving it a try - because it's so nutrition dense, the higher cost actually balances out."

The ONLY thing I don't like about it is that it MAY contain peanut, and my wheat-allergic daughter is also deathly allergic to peanut.  So, she can't eat it.  I can and I do.  She's jealous, because she started eating it and ate a couple of bites before she read where it might contain peanut, and she (picky, picky, picky eater) loved it.

Now my 60 lb pit mix ""goes"" just once daily and my 20 lb terrier/lab mix ""goes"" just twice.<br /><br />I also read that bad foods contributed to a dogs allergies and bloating. My pit mix would have these huge disgusting ""eye boogers"" all day long no matter how often I'd wipe his face and my terrier mix had these dark (his coat is a sandy color) tear stains from his constantly watering eyes. Not anymore! The ""eye boogies"" have disappeared and the tear stains are gone! Although I never noticed any bloating in my little dog I did notice that my muscular pit mix had a ""fat"" stomach. Needless to say that is gone as well!<br /><br />Lastly, I noticed that both dogs have been shedding less and that their coats are so much softer and shinier. What pleasant surprises!

When the humans in the house get a special bit of food, the kitties do also. They are my all day companions and when the humans celebrate so do the cats.  The biggest CON for the product is the cost, which depending upon the specials in force at the time make it about a dollar a can which is 3 oz--filet migion anyone??? But on the PLUS side, the kitties lap up the entire can without the usual bits of this and that left over depending upon how well they like the daily fare. ALSO, both of my cats are male which makes them prone to urinary tract problems. In addition to pure white meat chichen, this has a watery sauce with it which they ""slurp"" right up which adds to their daily fluid intake. After reading many books on cats and kittens, I decided that these male animals needed at least half of their daily fare in ""wet food"" to avoid urinary type probs. This really helps as cats are not noted fluid imbibers unless the fluid is sauce based (or is my lemonade which they make sure to contaminate--UGH!). So I love them and spend a little extra from time to time. The humans in the house make out well too!!!! Best wishes to all and hope this helps. December 2008"

If you check out the ingredients list for many of the common brands you find at the grocery store, you'll see the first couple of ingredients are *not* meat, but rather grains.  As well, the meat typically is made up of by-products, which are not suitable for human consumption.  Yes,  I know, we're not going to be consuming our feline companion's food, but the reality is with cats and their funky digestive tract issues, their food should not contain grain or meat by-products, plain and simple.<br /><br />There are a number of outstanding grain-free cat foods out there, but this one in particular our cats eat happily.  One of our cats was significantly overweight, and with NOW recommended by our veterinarian , my fiancee gave it a try. At the time he began this food, we were actually living on opposite coasts and I hadn't seen the cats in roughly 8 months given my travels.  When I saw our cat after that absence, I was shocked to see how slimmed down he was and how healthy he had become.  Using this food, in combination with that feeding bowl in which the cats have to stick their paws into to retrieve the food (looks like a flying saucer) has been the key to success!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product is not widely stocked at pet care places in our area, but I am delighted that Amazon carries it.  I've been able to order it, trouble-free, and the food arrives fresh and ready to be consumed.  I highly recommend this brand and encourage you to read the ingredient labels on anything you feed your pet-companions."

No hyperbole ---- it's literally the only thing that I can keep in the fridge that will keep me away from Diet Coke.  It might seem a bit pricey, but for my health I think it is worth every penny.  I just wish they would stock a larger size so I wouldn't feel so bad about all of the discarded plastic bottles.  Also, this may seem a small point but I am a sculptor and thoughtful graphic design is very important to me.  I always get compliments when I hand these out to guests ---- both on the flavor and the wonderful packaging.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are the pear and the watermelon.  They are very subtle.  My husband's favorite is the honeydew-hibiscus.  I like it, too, but it has a tiny sour floral tang to the taste.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this product highly enough."

He has never had any problems with it. No constipation at all infact he goes x2-x3 daily. I have also read some bad stuff on internet such as the recent study  condeming this formula and yet I still stand by it and will continue using it.

I think the coating has the same flavor profile as old fashioned dry roasted peanuts, the slightly seasoned ones I remember my grandma always having a jar of.<br /><br />I guess these are really a love them or leave them type of product; you'll notice the very high or very low star ratings, not one 3 star review when I tasted these.  I think the split is because the almonds do not have the word ""seasoned"" in the title so people looking for plain almonds feel duped.  I also see that some people are mad about them containing MSG; it is listed clearly in the ingredient list so you can avoid it if you have problems consuming it.  Some people get sick or bad headaches so this is an important thing to be aware of if you are sensitive.<br /><br />I can see how someone would be put off by any flavor if they were looking for plain; my advice is to always hunt down the ingredient list to any food you are planning to buy without tasting first, especially if ordering in bulk.  I went to the grocery store and got one jar of these to see if I liked them, when these are gone I will be getting these in bulk here on amazon since I paid almost $6 for one jar.

B0014X5O1C,A1QVFHPY8418HC,monkuboy,0,0,5,2008-05-13,Very refreshing sparklers,"The Clementine (orange) flavor of Izze is my favorite among the three I have tried, the other two being apple and grapefruit. This is a very crisp, refreshing beverage that has just the right balance of fruit to carbonation, and a slight tartness that keeps it from being cloying or flabby. Some reviewers have commented and even complained about this sparkling juice having only the barest amount of carbonation.  Not so with the ones I have tried, so perhaps these other reviewers left the top open and allowed it to go flat or something. Believe me, this had lively carbonation, and a good, natural tasting tart orange flavor.  The size of the can is convenient, too - takes up hardly any space in the fridge or in the lunch sack.<br /><br />As part of the ""Vine"" program, I received and tasted three different flavors but Amazon will not allow me to publish a separate review of each flavor.  So I am combining them all into one.<br /><br />Apple flavor: like biting into a crisp, green apple and savoring the peel and the fruit/meat at the same time. It has nice, clean and refreshing flavors with an excellent balance of carbonation. Normally I am not a fan of apple juice or sparkling cider but this one I liked.  It is not cloying or flabby-tasting as I find most apple beverages to be, probably because this is green and not red apple-flavored.<br /><br />Grapefruit flavor: this was my least favorite of the bunch, but if you prefer a very tart flavor, this fits the bill nicely. Again, a good balance of carbonation, crisp, and refreshing, this had good pink grapefruit taste but I also detected a plastic-tasting element.  The aftertaste was pure grapefruit so I don't know where that plastic came from or where it went, but it did mar an otherwise nice drinking experience.<br /><br />Overall I rate these Izze beverages very high.  They taste good, they are refreshing, and come in convenient-sized cans that easily fit in the fridge or a lunch sack or back pack. Good products!"

B000WFKWDI,A2WHV0YLBOK0I0,Go Flash Go!,4,4,5,2012-04-02,Kittens go nuts for this!,"I recently adopted two 8 week old kittens.  Their ""foster mother"" had been feeding them Wellness Canned for Kittens, along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CE77Q"">Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Flavor, 6 Pound Bag</a>, so I decided to keep this consistent.  Also, the information the foster mother gave me on what I had thought was high quality cat food (Iams, Purina One, Science Diet) completely changed my outlook.  There is no way I would ever feed that garbage to any of my pets again.<br /><br />My kittens go crazy when I feed them the Wellness twice a day.  Their desperate meows almost sound like gasps - so cute.  I don't want them to become solely dependent on canned, so I will continue to provide them with dry food, too.  (Although, I plan to replace Chicken Soup with a higher quality, grain-free dry brand, like Orijen or Evo.)  And when the kittens are old enough, I will transition them to Wellness canned for adults.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, there's probably a good chance you already know all about cat nutrition (the issues with by-products, brewers rice, corn, some grains, etc.)  For anyone else, I would encourage you to read the nutritional information on various brands at Pet Food Ratings dot Net.  You will never look at cat food the same.<br /><br />***Update October 2012***: Since my original review, I have tried two other kinds of Wellness canned foods - sliced chicken (in the 3 oz. can) and turkey (12.5 oz. cans).  They love both.  Because the 12 oz. cans are much more economical on a per ounce basis, I am going to stick with this size.  (Tip - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ARWTA"">Ethical 3-1/2-Inch Pet Food Can Covers, 3-Pack</a> fit perfectly on the 12.5 oz. cans, and other reviewers have stated that they fit on the 5.5 oz can.  They are too large for the 3 oz. cans, however.)<br /><br />I continue to feed a combination of both wet and dry food.  As I mentioned above, I wanted to switch to a grain-free dry food.  I selected <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BOVE54"">Wellness Grain-Free Dry Cat Food for Adult Cats & Kittens, CORE Original Fish & Fowl Recipe, 12 lb. Bag</a>, and my cats love it."

B000VK08OC,ARBR8471NTSMH,Filet Mignon,10,11,5,2011-03-06,Yummy in my Tummy,"Them bees sure spit out a delicious concoction eh? Ok that's not the best image of honey but it is what it is! It's delicious bee spit, fantastic stuff! The honey you buy in supermarkets is mostly devoid (fancy vocabulary for does not have) of nutrients since it has been purged through the heating process. You want natural, organic, raw honey like Wedderspoon's honey. Like yogurt, it has active cultures in it, which is good for you. A lot of people do not like the concept of living cultures in one's food, thinking it's gross or harmful. But I tell you what... if you did not have the friendly bacteria living in your intestines then your pooper would have one heck of a time my good friend! Also, raw honey has antibacterial properties, which is good for getting rid of the bad stuff in our body. Wedderspoon gives you not 1... not 3... but 16+ active cultures! They sure are generous with their cultures! Also, for the ladies, honey is great for the face. A lot of girls use honey to make a honey mask. You get distilled water, a bit of honey, and make a paste out of it. Mix well and apply to your face. If some of it slips downward, you can catch some with your tongue and get a little snack :). I put my honey on my loaf of bread mainly, but sometimes I get inspired by Pooh Bear and go at it standalone with just a spoon. Let's just say you definitely want some bread. Make sure you keep this thing away from the sun as the UV light from the sun will kill your active cultures. Reduced cultures = reduced nutritional benefit. Here is the summary:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-Organic and raw, not processed<br />-16+ live cultures that are good for you<br />-Can be used to make a honey mask as an external facial mask for the skin<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-Does not come free<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTES:<br /><br />-Keep away from sunlight, the UV kills the active cultures."

One set of leaves did fall off, and that made me even more concerned, but as things turned out I needn't have worried.<br /><br />These plants enjoy bright indirect sunlight and a lot of humidity, but don't want to be overwatered, so I set it in front of the window but behind another plant to filter the sunlight, and put it in a pan with water and pebbles so that the bottom of the pot doesn't touch the water but the water can evaporate around the plant to provide humidity. It has been less that two weeks now and the plant is growing six new shoots, each one of which has five tiny leaves. That's 30 new leaves, so I know the plant is now adjusted and doing well.<br /><br />If you do an online search for ""Breathe Easier: 12 Houseplants to Purify Indoor Air"" you'll find a list of some of the best indoor plants to have, which toxins each plant is best at removing from the air (according to NASA studies), and a brief description of how to care for them. More detailed instructions can also be found by searching online for each plant's name.<br /><br />The Money Tree Plant and the Areca Palm are the two plants on the list that require a little more care, but there is also a plant called the Mother-in-Law's Tongue that is extremely hardy and needs very little care at all. If you don't have the ability to care for plants, you should choose those that are easier to care for.<br /><br />The Money Tree Plant is one of the top three on the list of the best indoor air-cleansing plants, and I'm very happy with this one. It looked exactly like the picture when it arrived and looks even better now. When I want new plants I won't hesitate to order from this seller again."

B000A10TV4,A3IXMQOUXOEK43,Robert C. Vincent,6,6,5,2012-06-02,Compared to the competition these are the best (My dogs love these!),"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was purchasing Canyon Creek (and Waggin' Train) yams for my dogs from the pet store.  They loved the taste but I couldn't stand the smell.  The preservative used is a bisulfite (I incorrectly state bisulfate in my review) and it breaks down to sulfur dioxide (one of the smells of burning matches) on standing.  I don't know if they use too much preservative but either way I never liked the thought of so much of it being there.  Although the Canyon Creek came from China I figured how could they screw up yams?  Anyway, I saw these in the store and saw the Made in the USA label and decided to give them a try.  For me they are better in every way, cheaper, no smell, last longer on chewing, better texture, bigger sizes.<br /><br />Some other notes that I forgot to include in the video, they are labeled as vegetable rawhides, they don't last anywhere near as long as a real rawhide.  Maybe a minute for my big dog.  Also some reviewers noted that their dogs either didn't like them or got sick after eating them.  My dogs experience no loose stools or vomiting and they will beg for these treats readily when I go for the bag (obvious in the video when I pull the treat from the bag and he immediately comes up to grab it), but again this depends on the dog.  These treats fit very well with my wish to feed my dogs a quality product whenever price will allow.<br /><br />Edit:  The price on these seems to fluctuate heavily.  When I bought these and wrote the review they were $9.99, that was a good deal for what they are and comparable with the other brands, but at $18.99 a bag I wouldn't really consider them worth it any more and I would buy other treats instead."

However, even though my cats love them, I only allow them a quater of a crumbled biscuit a couple times a week.  Although ground chicken bone is 1 of the lesser ingredients, you do not find ""bone meal"" or any other waste product such as ""brewers rice"" orother nutritionally depeleted fillers.  Just plenty or good dark greens, carrots, apples and butternut squash to help make  a biscuit out of the Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver and Turkey Heart that form the protein base of this healthy treat.  There is a small amount of honey in the product as well.  The ingredients list is one of the best I've seen on a commercially available pet product in a long time.<br /><br />Both my cats and my dog anjoyed the treats a little too much so I have to hide them behind a locked cabinet door!  My favorite aspect of this treat is the lack of dyes and the fact that they aren't rock hard.  They are easy to divide into sensible servings for the cats and probably better for them than their own dry food even though I use a high quality dry food for the cats and feed mostly a meat diet to the dogs.  This is a ""raw"" product, which means the ingredients where not cooked above a certain temperature.  The product was then freeze-dried to presevre freshness.  As long as you keep the bag well-sealed and out of direct heat & sunlight, you shouldn't have any problems with spoilage.<br /><br />They recommend 1 to 2 bites per day per 20 Lbs of body weight and to asjust for your feeding accordingly.  Obviously that means subtracting a little if you plan to use these as a daily supplement.  Again, with the cats, I cut the disk in half and then crumbled half of that into pieces and used it as a training reward.  If you arent' sure what the correct amount is for your pet, you should talk to your vet, call the company or err on the side of offering less rather than more.  Overfeeding even a well-formulated food can lead to obesity, especially if your pets love these Boost Bites as much as mine did."

All his food EXCEPT for the NurturMe products that is!  I found their peas and apples while I was on vacation and was completely shocked at how fresh, bright, and tasty they are.  I refused to feed my child that grey stuff that passes for canned baby peas even from supposed ""organic"" or healthy brands because it isn't anything I would personally want to eat due to the processed taste and color.  As the other reviewer stated, I've honestly never tasted peas that were so fresh and sweet.  I would never have thought that dried baby foods would produce such a fresh looking and tasting end result, but they look and taste so much better than anything that is canned or in the plastic pouches.  I tried buying fresh or frozen organic peas myself and making my own pea puree but it never came out as nice as these.  When I used fresh or frozen peas my baby wouldn't eat them because I was never able to get the pea skins pureed fine enough and he kept choking and coughing while he ate them.  I make my own sweet potato, squash, blueberry, etc. but these are really the only green vegetables that he seems to love.  My only complaint is that they can be hard to find in supermarkets or big box stores.  Thanks Amazon for keeping them in stock.  And, yes, they are super handy for mixing into other foods or taking them on the go, but for me the main selling point of these is the fresh sweet taste which makes my baby scarf them down!"

I also find that it has a mood enhancing effect. The taste is fine, like a concentrated energy drink, but you're not drinking it for the taste.

What I hadn't realized is that usually most grocers sell LONG grain rice, which doesn't have the texture or flavor of this wonderful rice. Short grain brown rice swells up when steamed and has a chewy texture, not mushy. It tastes great with a bit of olive oil and sea salt when served. I followed the directions on the package, which is 2 1/2 cups of water for every cup of rice and simmer covered for about 45 minutes after it starts boiling. But my rice came out a bit hard, so I added 1/2 more water and it came out perfect. So the ratio is 1 cup of rice: 3 cups water. I love this rice!"

I had all 5 bottles lines up in my shower, but of course, I couldn't try them all at once because some of the performance is based on cleaning ability, feel of hair afterwards, and lingering smell.  So over the course of a week, I tried each shampoo to rate them.  Meanwhile, my bottles of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCUTKI"">Head & Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KN8UA"">Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043OYFJQ"">Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)</a> watched in fear.<br /><br />All of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  Clear Men brings the advertised ""bio nutrium 10"", a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.<br /><br />The shampoo color is white (not blue like H&S), and is a little bit more runny.  However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  This formulation advertises it is ""Dry Scalp Hydration"".  It does not have a strong cooling/burning feel like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC"">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, and does not smell as strong as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449CE"">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>.  It has a light aroma of tea-tree oil and mint and is a great every-day shampoo.<br /><br />The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff.  There was no real lasting smell or feel to it.  I didn't need a separate conditioner because this particular shampoo is a 2-in-1.  As I rinsed it out, my hair brushed and controlled easily without the need for conditioner as well.<br /><br />I like the Clear Men's line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  They are all recommended, or get whichever one is the cheapest at the time."

The dual-lid system helps to keep spices fresh for longer, and yet is very easy to remove without any hassle. The included spice spoon fits in the space between the lid and the cover when not in use, so you will never have to worry about losing it.<br /><br />Even the red velvet bag the dabba came in was of impressive quality; my wife loved it enough to keep for storage of other items in the kitchen. This product sits on our counter within easy reach at all times. Apart from the usefulness of having it around, it is also a great conversation starter; almost every guest who sees it is fascinated and ends up ordering one for themselves.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, you probably already know what a spice dabba is, and are just wondering if the Ajika product is worth buying. This gets an easy five stars from me, and I intend to purchase more as gifts in the future. It may cost more than some competing products from other brands, but it is money well spent, as I have no doubt that this item will be around long enough to pass off to my children some day."

Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a ""good"" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought ""stuff"", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes!

B001BCVY9W,A2K3DB7X56UXLZ,JC Chupack,1,1,5,2008-12-22,Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict,"My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys. It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens! When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him. After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food. First, I want it to have real ingredients listed. I don't like for it to have by-products. (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food) Second, I don't want it to stink. If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it. Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria. Next was the big question: would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off. He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting. Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior. He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day. I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn. It really looks like people food. He seemed to really enjoy the ""soupy"" broth. This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off. He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest. Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken. It smelled pleasantly like Asian food. His reaction was to sniff and wander off. After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food. So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor. I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM. It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day. A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior. He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits. I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily. Clearly, my kitty has preferences. I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)) that are available on Amazon. He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past. It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand. I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance. That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general. The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup."
B002OVS8KW,A2YMZM2WJS9C0L,"Sue E. Ramsey ""Sue E. Ramsey""",0,0,5,2011-08-09,Great tasting with help keeping energy up.,"I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost."

He LOVES them. Firstly, if my dog was not a toy size dog I would not be feeding him this very often, it is EXPENSIVE. For my 8lb it would be 3 large bags a month, $80. So no way. I find a way to get discounts and it ends up being $60/mo for an 8lb pup.<br /><br />The packaging says your dog should drink 1/4 cup water for every patty, so i make sure i serve them re-hydrated so that i don't have to worry that he's drinking enough water afterward. He gobbles it up without fail.<br /><br />They are easy to measure, for my dog's size he eats about 3 1/4 patties a day, I break the patty into quarters and put them in water to rehydrate; they are ready to serve in less than 2 minutes. The ingredients are awesome and not only do they include all the meat products as the first ingredients but then vegetables that follow are organic. And to top it off they include probiotics for intestinal health.<br /><br />I can't report any increase in energy or anything like that because my dog is only 2 years old so he's got all the energy in the world. But i love that raw-type foods, even if not the frozen kind, are very easy to digest compared to dry food, that's always better for the system.<br /><br />Anyway, we've only tried this flavor so far, duck is next. : )<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken Ground with Bone, Chicken Liver, Chicken Gizzard, Pumpkin Seed, Potassium Chloride, Organic Cranberries, Organic Spinach, Organic Broccoli, Organic Beets, Sodium Phosphate Monobasic, Organic Carrots, Organic Squash, Organic Apples, Organic Blueberries, Choline Chloride, Dried Pediococcus Acidilactici Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Bifidobacterium Longum Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Taurine, Tocopherols (Preservative), Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Iron Sulfate, Iron Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Sulfate, Sodium Selenite, Manganese Proteinate, Thiamine Monohydrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin B12 Supplement.

They are durable enough that pieces don't break off and there is minimal risk of choking.  They seem to last forever but are soft enough that the dogs want to chew on them.  I bought the largest size because I have medium and large sized dogs.  That also minimizes risk of choke and/or other injury.  They are also easy to spot in the yard when mowing the grass.  If you do accidentally run one over, they break or splinter and leave sharp edges.  I would remove them from your dogs yard in that event.  Otherwise, the dogs seem to like them (are willing to pick them up, take them from you, and carry them around) and chew on them quite often.  They are great for mildly interactive toys but do not provide a lot of exercise - other than chewing.  Good ""keep your dog busy so you can get stuff done"" toys!  :)"

I really wanted to make these creme filled candies from the Sprinkles Bakes blog and since she recommended using an official candy coating (not just melted down chips) I found these. I made my candy last night and they turned out amazing. The quality of the chocolate is fantastic - I ordered the dark and I would say that even someone who only likes milk chocolate would like these too. It's great dark chocolate. I melted the candy down in a glass bowl over a pot of simmering water and dipped my creme confections in the bowl. The coating sets in about 30 - 60 seconds, so although I put mine in the refrigerator after dipping them - they'd probably stay hard enough if you didn't want to do that. The coating was very even and the end result was really spectacular. This might seem like more money versus the store bought chips but I think for quality and purpose, like candy or cake dipping, this chocolate is really the best. I would also say you could use this chocolate for any kind of chocolate decorating - if you were going to shape the chocolate in a certain way (like Mickey Mouse ears for a decorative cake) or anything where you need to make a shape - this would work really well because of how quickly it sets. I would buy this product again and highly recommend it."

So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good."

I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond.

Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving.

B000LKYZDW,ABLXFZDC71O7E,Rachel,1,1,5,2012-06-27,"Crisp, tasty snack for an occasional treat!","These crispy apple chips are just that.  Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.<br /><br />Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.<br /><br />I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.<br /><br />Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?  They're one of the best light, crunchy treats I've found and they're incredibly tasty.  I love 'em!"

The first listed ingredient is chili peppers (in contrast to so many whose primary ingredient seems to be vinegar); it is hot without be mouth-numbingly so. It really is a delightful addition to a Bloody Mary (but, I must admit, I use it on many, many other things, from scrambled eggs to tostadas to all kinds of soups). I purchased this product from Amazon through Mex-Grocer; recently one of my shipments was lost in transit. They were so very great about following through, rectifying the situation, and apologizing that I wouldn't consider ordering from anyone else in the future.

They are fantastic! The portion is quite generous - enough to tame that hunger that gets you between breakfast and lunch. The graham cracker is very crunchy but does not fall apart when you bite into it. The peanut butter filling is thick and satisfying. The overall flavor is very favorable - a tad sweet but not cloying (like so many prepackaged snack bars are). They are very convenient and tidy to eat, and they really help fill the mid-morning hunger void and carry you through to lunch. I'm an adult but these would make a great snack for kids, too - especially after school to carry a kid through until dinner. Pair one with a few apple slices on the side and you've got it made! I really hope these make it on the market and are not discontinued like so many awesome new products tend to be. I'll be buying them every week! Nice work, Honey Maid!!!"

Keeping a plastic bag over the bag the plant is in for an extremely long time, months even.  Once it gets growing...<br />2.) Transferring the plant into a self-watering pot and keeping it in as much sun as possible (I'm an indoor gardener lol).<br /><br />Now, for me, the trick is to get it to STOP growing. :)  Also, the oregano is DELICIOUS.

This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!"

I don't like milk so I cook it in fruit juice, sometimes with dried fruit added.  When I cook it in orange juice, I add dried cranberries.  When I cook it in apple juice, I sprinkle cinnamon and just a little nutmeg on it.  I generally cook it in a crock pot set on low for several hours.<br /><br />Regarding the packaging:  Sure the cans get dinged up during shipment.  So what?  The oats don't suffer.

The ingredients listed are: Enriched wheat flour, corn meal, vegetable oil, sugar, invert sugar syrup, whey powder, honey, salt barley malt extract, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, monocalcium phosphate.

Many Southerners will tell you that their favorite dessert, caramel cake, was a treat reserved for very special occasions. Despite the near universal love for caramel cake in the South, it was almost impossible for ordinary mortals to make. Thus the preparation of caramel cake was left to the loving hands of ""cake ladies"" who in their home kitchens prepared the great Southern delights such as lemon cheese cake (this has nothing to do with cheese cake-the filing is lemon curd) and the quintessential waistline expander-caramel cake.<br /><br />The trick to making caramel cake is in the icing. This cake has nothing to do with Kraft squares or squeezed-on gook from your local supermarket bakery. It is brown sugar and other good stuff carefully stirred in a double boiler until it is caramelized, when it is thickly applied to ordinary yellow cake. Most cooks make two layers. Caroline serves seven.<br /><br />In several days from the preparation of this review ""The Help"" will reach the big screen. Prominently featured in this movie, like all true and exaggerated tales of the real life South, is caramel cake. The cake these ladies serve is actually the one featured in this review-seven layers of pure joy from Caroline. I have had a couple of Caroline's caramel cakes over the past few years. Each one of them has been perfect, arriving at my home in South Florida via Fed Ex in pristine condition. Before discovering Caroline I had for years ordered them from cake ladies in small towns across the South who packed them up and put them on a Greyhound to arrive at odd hours at the bus station. Federal Express is definitely the preferred method of shipping since bus stations are usually not in great neighborhoods. Additionally these cake ladies seem to be dying out and finding replacements has not been easy.<br /><br />Caroline, by contrast is now not only an entrepreneur but an institution already discovered by Hollywood. The demand for these cakes will be incredible once The Help is released. Unless you know a real Southern cake lady, Caroline is your best bet. In fact, even if you do know a cake lady, she is still your best bet."

Our daughter likes it plain with salt and a bit of olive oil blended in. I like adding a nice sauce with vegetables over the cous cous (such as the delicious 5-minute Indian dish, Tasty Bite Jaipur Vegetables, that I also buy on Amazon). Also wonderful with legumes of any kind, or served with chicken or fish as a nice change of pace from rice or pasta. I hope that Amazon carries it again soon. Your get a lot of servings in each box so it is healthy, delicious, and a good value. My only complaint -- and this is not the fault of the product -- is that the case we recently received had an expiration date only 2 months out. Most products are still good past the posted dates, and we like it so I'm sure we will manage to eat it before it goes stale, but Amazon should be more careful with their stock control."

After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

(She'll get her act together eventually, but I digress.)  Plus, it contains a bit of licorice extract, which is also sweet.  One reviewer said it tastes bad, but I disagree wholeheartedly.<br /><br />What really cool is it contains no CAFFEINE, no PESTICIDES and no FLUORIDE.  That is hard to find:  a green tea in any form without fluoride (which we all know is bad for us).  So that's a great thing.<br /><br />I had no idea that green tea helps with joint pain and stiffness and arthritis, etc. beforehand.  I was taking it for weight loss and energy.  But I found it was making my joints feel much better, so I'm moving around more, exercising more and am sleeping like a Princess (however Princesses sleep...).  I guess my joint pain had crept up on me slowly over the years and I was assuming the sleep I was getting was ""normal,"" but when I took this stuff I noticed in only a week that I was pain free during sleep which made me realize my prior sleep condition was not ""normal"" at all.  Bingo, now that I'm getting better quality sleep, I'm less hungry, am moving more and have more energy.  This stuff is great.<br /><br />Previously, as someone on thyroid meds, I had to stay away from all the green teas out there because they contained fluoride (which works against thyroid meds).  Now I can get the benefits of green tea without the bad things that come from fluoride, and PESTICIDES and some of the other things that come along with the NON-ORGANIC green teas out there.  NOTE:  Not ALL organic green tea products are FLUORIDE FREE, but this one IS!<br /><br />This stuff is my new best buddy!

And of course like plain xylitol, it's much drier than sugar, but adding a little applesauce to whatever I'm baking helps with that.<br /><br />But mostly I use it on my breakfast cereal - sprinkling cinnamon in the bottom of the bowl, adding <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TXT502"">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> and a handful of raisins, microwaving it, and topping it with Ideal Brown no-cal sweetener.

Maca is surely classified as a superfood, and why that is the case pertains to its exceptional potency. General speaking, the ""better"" a superfood tastes, the lower (that's right, the lower) the nutritional density. And why would this be the case? Well, simply because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as Maca, chlorella, spirulina, broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas, processed fruit juices, etc.<br />Fortunately, since it's abundantly obvious to me that not everything that's good for me is going to taste like a Ritter Sport chocolate bar, I've been able to get past the subjective definitions or pronouncements on Maca's taste or flavor -- and most reviews by far out there, by the way, indicate a much more neutral, even positive assessment of Maca's taste. I for one, like so many Americans, want really good and sustainable energy, not the kind that comes at any kind of unnatural price, e.g., sudden crashes, nervousness, the jitters, stomach aches, headaches, cramps, etc. Fortunately through Maca, I've found significantly increased energy, overall alertness, focus, and enhanced powers of concentration....not to mention the physical energy for my lengthy & strenuous workouts. Though I jus' luvs me my coffee, there are numerous ways of getting that energy without the price of the smaller dives, total crashes and inevitable burn-outs.<br />If this entirely natural, special Maca-kind-of-boost is not important to you, then you don't need to try it.<br /><br />Having communicated all this, careful readers of all of the reviews here will probably be able to see why some do not like Organic Raw Maca Powder, often linked to questions about taste, culinary expectations, etc. To note, it's difficult for me to place much weight on reviews by those who have tried out a food (and I view Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Maca Powder, not as a product, but as an exceptional nutritional food) for only a few days (only 3!, in some instances) or a few weeks. Generally speaking, the better a superfood tastes, the lower the nutritional density, and this is because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as wheat grass, spinach, barley grass, chlorella, spirulina, green tea (extract), broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas or processed fruit juices."

Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it broke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite brew in a K-cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.

How to dispense this? Here is what I came up with, and it seems to work. Buy a spigot: I purchased a Carlisle 2212, but Amazon has a Tomlinson Ceramic Crock Lever Faucet, which seems to be the same. They have a 3/4 inch threaded shaft, rubber washers, and a nut to seal the spigot. I drilled a 3/4 inch hole in the cap, cleaned the hole with a file and sandpaper, and installed the spigot onto the cap. Then I screwed the cap onto the container and put it in place in the basement, where I will fill smaller bottles from the spigot. It seems not to leak and should work fine. I hope this helps others.""<br />Now, a couple of weeks later, I have dispensed two bottles from the jug, and the spigot works fine without leaks. I punched a small hole in the top of the jug to let in air."

We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She ""cautiously"" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says ""You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!"". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and ""no way!"" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage ""dining room"". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his ""Happy"" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to ""shop around"" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online.

Then one day I saw this product advertised on TV and immediately researched it online and decided to purchase it from Amazon.<br /><br />At the time I purchased it I also decided to get the Italian Herbs seed kit. We decided to plant the herbs we thought we would use the most from both kits, so we ended up using a few from the kit it comes with and a few from the kit we ordered. Everything germinated early with one exception, the cilantro, to this day it still has not germinated. I did finally give up on it and bought a package of seeds from the store and pushed a few seeds into the sponge a few days ago. I will update this later and let you know if they germinated. It seems from the reviews that I am not the only one with the cilantro problem.<br /><br />I recommend this product to everyone I know who loves to grow herbs, but would prefer not to deal with the dirt and bugs.<br /><br />We received the Gourmet Herb kit with our AeroGrow Garden, it contains:<br />Italian Basil, Cilantro, Mint, Dill, Parsley, Chives and Purple Basil<br /><br />We purchased separately the Italian Herb kit, it contains:<br />Mint, Basil, Savory, Parsley, Garlic Chives, Oregano, and Thyme<br /><br />Update: No luck with the Cilantro.

It contains more potassium than one banana and only contains 60 calories.<br /><br />Potassium is key and it has 15 times more than sports drinks;  as those of us who have problems with muscle cramping are relieved to know.  I think it is probably the  best natural drink that I have found to promote hydration.<br /><br />I love the natural, the passion fruit and the mango flavors.  All of them taste natural because they are..they are not sweet and the fruit flavors are really only the essence of the flavor itself and are quite subtle tasting.<br /><br />I can't think of a better or more healthy drink...in fact because of its potassium content, I consider it a better drink than plain water.  It also contains a healthy complement of phosphorous, magnesium and calcium with even a gram of protein.<br /><br />Enjoy this drink experience after exercising and you will never feel faint and/or dehydrated again.<br /><br />Bentley/2009"

B000LQORES,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,Westley,1,1,5,2011-04-15,A yummy quick lunch,"Nong Shim noodle bowls are a definite step up in quality from the typical cup noodles.  They are simple to prepare: just add boiling water and let sit for about 3 minutes (I prefer my noodles a bit softer and let them sit at least 5 minutes).  The bowls provide a generous amount of noodles to make a filling lunch.  The Spicy Chicken variety is my favorite so far (better than the Beef & Ginger).  The broth is fairly spicy but not too much for the average palate.  Along with the noodles, there are pieces of dehydrated vegetables as well as chicken pieces.  The chicken pieces taste ok but are spongy and look kind of disgusting; I have thought about picking them out before adding the water but haven't bothered.  As other reviewers have noted, the bowls are high in sodium; however, you can use less of the seasoning packet if that is a concern.  For the price, these noodle bowls are a real winner, and they have become a frequent work-time lunch for me.<br /><br />I should note that when I ordered then from here, the case was slightly crushed and about 1/3 of the bowls were somewhat smashed.  Fortunately, the bowls were not broken and did not leak; however, because they were uneven in depth, not all the noodles were submerged in water, so they cooked unevenly.  I'm sure Amazon would have allowed me to return the bowls, but it seemed like too much hassle."

It's reasonably fresh, the grains are reasonably whole, and I'm reasonably pleased too!<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about some broken grains.  I feel that is probably inevitable after shipping, and since I live a long ways from the wild rice fields, I'm going to have to accept the broken grains as part of the deal.  There aren't many, it's very much whole grain and ""fancy"" grade.  I'd serve this to guests or my family without worries.<br /><br />We don't generally mix wild rice while cooking, preferring to mix other rices in after cooking them separately so that I don't have to worry about different ratios of cooking time, water, etc.  Typically, I use wild rice in a wild rice pilaf or stuffing for poultry.

I bought this pump <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CJR62S"">Syrup Sauce Pump - 1 1/2"" (38mm) For Ghirardelli, Torani, and Da Vinci</a> for this bottle, since I read other pumps may not fit, and I haven't had a problem.<br /><br />I heated 1 cup of skim milk with a couple of tablespoons of Torani SF syrup and a pump of this sauce, mixed it with my cheap Ikea frother, and added it to a cup of hot coffee. Sugar free mocha on the cheap!"

It is nearly impossible to find cookies he can eat as almost all wheat free cookie recipes call for rice flour or oats. We were hesitant to try these because the Bob's wheat free brownies are pretty bad, but I'm SO glad we did! These were delicious and free of all of my son's allergens (the chocolate chips contain soy lecithin but his allergist said that does not contain enough soy protein to cause a reaction)! Not to mention so easy to make! It has directions for substituting the egg right on the package, and we used Earth Balance Soy Free Buttery Spread instead of butter. I did have to cook them for about 21 minutes instead of just 15 as the package states, but they outside is nice and crisp while the middles are still soft and delicious. I will definitely be buying this mix again!!"

It's amazing, not overpoweringly intense  or bitter.  I never got to making the lattes as I ran out drinking it straight!  Just opening the tin, you are enveloped in a soft cinnamon/clove/ginger-y goodness. After all the sachets were gone, I left the tin open to ""perfume"" my room!!<br /><br />Also, love that Gypsy teas come in tins. One, it keeps the tea fresher longer and out of the damaging sunlight and two, I can refill them with my various loose teas when I've run out of the sachets!

Before, to add a little heat to chili, nacho cheese, tacos, or whatever else I like to have hot, I had to add some kind of hot sauce.  However, no matter how hot whatever I was using was, by the time I added enough in to bring the heat up, it's all I could taste!  With this, I can make my chili as hot or mild as I want, and still have it taste like chili.  And because I only use a few drops at a time, this stuff will last me forever!  To some, it may seem expensive for a small bottle of what they think is hot sauce, but it is so much more!"

I originally found this product at the Highway61 Coffeehouse in Vicksburg, and then ordered it from Amazon.  It is an excellent natural fruit drink in 8.4 ounce (248 ml) pop-top cans.  It contains white grape, apple, blackberry, raspberry, lemon, and red grape juice concentrates, reconstituted with sparkling water for the equivalent of 70 percent fruit juice.  A good juice for breakfast, lunch, or snacktime.<br /><br />I have also tried the sparkling pomegranate flavor, and I do not recommend that flavor which I thought was somewhat yuck.  It is a combination of apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry, and pomegranate.  That combination should go back to the drawing board.  For reasons unknown, Amazon lumps all the reviews together, without regard to the fact that the products are substantially different."

We eat a lot of Morningstar soy-burgers so I had respect for Worthington right away. I had been adding dry soy to my home-made vegetarian chili. Now we use the Vegetarian Burger in my chili, spaghetti, enchiladas and lasagna. The first time my wife used it for spaghetti she said it looked like dog food. We use it once or twice a month and we still refer to it jokingly as ""dog food"". The VB has not much of its own flavor which is typical of soy products so use spices liberally. I like the convenience. I can turn out a big pot of chili with about 20 minutes of preparation and very little mess. Saute peppers and onions, add diced tomatoes and beans, pop in the Worthington VB, add the chili spices, simmer for as long as you like.<br />This product is not for everyone but it works for me. We have a ready supply of burger substitute that requires no refrigeration, minimal preparation and has no possibility of the kind of contamination that sometimes pops up with ground beef products. We are not strict vegetarians. We use soy product for the convenience and health benefits.<br />A tip: to get all the product out of the can just open both ends and push it out."

Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch ""Organix;"" he likes ""Evo"" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Amazon."

I doesn't matter what's on sale, what there is a coupon for, or even what is being given away. This is my coffee, this is what I want. That being said, this purchase, for me, was the deal of the decade. Where I live, one of these containers is $4.99. The price I paid for a six pack of them  was like getting 3 for free. This will last me well into summer. This coffee makes wonderful iced coffee, as well."
B000EICPAG,A1P58UJ3B7ARFW,Matthew T. Carpenter,6,7,5,2011-05-25,Indispensible for Thai cooking,"Here is a common recipe that shows the possibilities of fish sauce, Chicken and Holy Basil.  This is my favorite version, there are many others.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />The proportions of ingredients are strictly to your taste.  My wife and I will use one large chicken breast, a whole bell pepper and a medium onion.  Too much chicken makes the dish too meaty for my taste, but as long as it cooks uniformly there's no right or wrong.<br /><br />1-2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into about 1"" strips pieces.  I prefer all natural or organic, never frozen.  It costs more but tastes much better.  You can also add another chicken breast or two to scale up the recipe.  If you prefer, you can also cut the chicken into julienne pieces or even 1-2"" cubes.  It tastes great however you do it!<br />1 bell pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips. I prefer yellow, as it's sweeter than green.  If you want more vegetables, add another pepper or more onion.  Just increase the sauce a little bit.<br />3-4 cloves of garlic sliced thin<br />1 small to medium onion cut into thin slices<br />1-2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and sliced thin.  You can use Thai peppers or even serrano peppers if you like it more fiercely hot.  The amount of pepper controls the heat.  You can omit these if you don't have the palate for spicy.<br />1 cup fresh basil leaves.  If you can actually get Thai basil this is best, but any will do, the fresher the better.  Feel free to add extra, particularly if you are increasing the amount of chicken and vegetables.<br />Sauce (this can be doubled or tripled quite easily, to increase the amount of sauce with your dish):<br />1 tbsp black soy (in Asian specialty shops)<br />1 tbsp sugar<br />1 tbsp white vinegar<br />1/2 to 2 tbs Tiparos fish sauce - The amount you use really controls the flavor of the dish.  If you want it more authentic, use the higher amount; if you want it more tame, the smaller amount.<br /><br />Directions:<br />1.  On medium high heat, heat about 2 tbsp cooking oil in your wok until hot<br />2.  Add peppers, garlic and onion.  Saute a few minutes until they soften<br />3.  Add chicen.  Saute until almost cooked through.  If you use previously frozen chicken, or over cook at this point, the chicken will be tough.<br />4.  Add sauce and saute until chicken it is just cooked through.<br />5.  Turn off heat.  Add basil leaves, and stir until they wilt.<br />6.  Serve imediately with freshly cooked jasmine rice."

I mixed it with a bottle of cold water in a standard glass and it blended almost instantly.  It has a nice coffee taste with a hint of sugar but nothing over whelming.

I love giving it to her because it's so much more nutritious than some other choices she enjoys, like crackers. This is loaded with iron, calcium, and protein (things I'm particularly conscious of since we don't eat meat), and doesn't have any added salt.  Personally, I also like that it's non GMO.  It comes in packets that are easy to toss into my purse or her diaper bag for when we're out & about.<br /><br />I also love taking these along as a healthy snack for myself on days that I work - a good alternative to the coffee shop treats surrounding my office, especially on days when I haven't had the time to put together anything homemade to bring with me.<br /><br />The only things that would make me like this snack even more are: if it was organic (or non-certified but grown as-though), if the packets were made of a recyclable or biodegradable material, and if they sold boxes of larger quantities than 8 packets."

Well, in fact, this coffee is smooth and rich, and (if made right) not overpowering at all.

Crittendon,0,0,5,2010-02-03,So THAT'S what tea looks like!,"I think it's a sad commentary on our modern world that after decades of drinking tea, I only just discovered what tea leaves look like. I don't mean the flakes and powder in your typical tea bag...I mean actual leaves of tea.<br /><br />This is the best tea I've ever had. In some ways it doesn't even taste like tea (or what I've known as tea). It's less bitter, and less astringent.<br /><br />The only reservation I had about this product was the price, and I was a little concerned when I opened the first tin and saw that 1/3 of it was empty space. However, after using the product for a few weeks I think this tea is actually a great value. A little bit goes a long way. I've been drinking this tea daily for 3 weeks and I've only used 1/3 of a tin.  At that rate I would have used over 20 teabags, or two boxes (which I've come to realize are mostly wrapper, filter, and cardboard). Per serving, I think this is cheaper than any tea you can buy in the grocery store.<br /><br />Last thing is how to filter it. I bought this filter around the same time:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I68NCS"">Finum Brewing Medium Basket, Black</a><br />...and I can't recommend it highly enough."

Dog 1 had allergies and was scratching and putting her paw into her mouth.  After going on this food, she no longer had those issues and her coat looks fab. She's a black lab mix.  Dog 2 was adopted with horrendous inflammatory bowel problems and suspected allergies to common proteins.  We had to start him on a very restricted diet of only novel proteins and chose the Wellness Simple food.  He didn't enjoy it as much and when he was stable, we switched him to this and he did great.  He loves it and it has kept his gut stable.  Also a lab mix and his coat looks great on this food.  We use both the Wellness fish kibble and canned food.  Highly recommend.

Rishi hit the ball out of the park with this one.  The flavor is strong and full, but still sweet and comforting.  It is not as bitter or as harsh as many other Earl Greys.  It has a fresh taste and smell.  The tea is superbly balanced and tastes as if there is more to it than tea leaves and water.<br /><br />To compare to some other teas, to give you a better picture of what I mean, it is a fuller flavor than Bigelow, Twinnings, or Ahmad, while being not as delicate as Numi.  It does not have the synthetic taste and smell of Stash.  It is not quite as pungent and bitter as Tazo (which I do like).  Mostly, it compares to Teavana's Earl Grey Creme, which I also highly recommend, but is a more robust flavor, with less of the creamy mouth-feel.  I highly recommend this tea."

Crowder,2,2,5,2011-06-30,"If you're on the fence about which high quality food to start your dog on, START HERE!!!","I have an English bulldog, Kingston, who is 5 months old and LOVES this stuff.  He was raised on Puppy Chow and I tried many cheaper brands.  I was taking him out 5-6 times a day and I could tell he was miserable.  His coat was dull and he shedded and scratched constantly. So I decided I should switch to a better quality product.  I did a lot of research and can assure you that TOTW is the best product out there in terms of quality AND price.  Kingston's coat is velvety soft (I cheat a little by mixing in a few pumps of salmon oil) and he's pretty lean- not fat- a active for a bully!  About feeding though- he doesn't lick the bowl clean like everyone else.  The way I see it he is a ""low energy"" dog.  This stuff is high protein, high quality and designed for much more active breeds.  I'm just glad he'll actually eat it (wouldn't touch Nature's Balance LID) and not throw it up (Merrick's Before Grain).  So if your dog is like mine (couch potato) my advice would be to feed them the lower end amount.  Too much of this stuff and your pup may ""outgrow"" his body and this could lead to health issues.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CLWS8"">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, High Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison and Venison, 5 Pound Bag</a><br />Go with the small bag and see what your pup thinks"

They are delicious: each twist is about 4"" long and 5 pieces come in at about 130 calories. There are about 20 pieces per pack.  So these candies a great little pick-me-up for my desk drawer.<br /><br />For those of you interested in the organic aspect of Newman's Own, the good news is that the main ingredients are certified organic.  I appreciated that the 3 of the first four ingredients are certified organic (Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, & Organic Tapioca Syrup).  There is a distinction between organic and ""natural"" labels on products. Organic certification involves rigorous inspection to make sure the food source is pesticide-free, hormone-free, among other things.  The remaining ingredients were ones that I felt comfortable with eating (Corn syrup, Vegetable Gycerine, Sunflower oil, Elderberry extract--which is great for the stomach--, citric acid, Natural flavor, Pomegranate juice, and Licorice Root extract--also great for stomach ailments).<br /><br />To be clear, organic or otherwise, it is candy. And it has plenty of sugars in it.  But for me, when I'm dragging in the middle of a long day at work, a little piece of candy helps even out my blood sugar and holds me over until I can get home and eat dinner.<br /><br />The distinct flavor of Pomegranate comes through in these tastey licorice twists.  If you're looking for a candy that is a little different but still delicious, I would suggest these Pomegranate twists.  If you like twizzlers, Newman's Pomegranate twists taste even better and their organic source materials mean that you are eating higher-quality foods."

Following the problems associated with dog and cat foods last year we have been hesitant in buying a lot of the treats we previously bought for our animals because we haven't been convinced they were altogether safe.  When this product says it's good enough for human consumption but made for our pet we gave it a try.  It's all that and more... our dog loves these treats.  Our dog is a well trained and wonderful pet, truly one of the family.  I actually placed one of these treats on the floor along with three other kinds of treats she really likes.  I told her she could have one.  She sniffed each of them and when I told her to ""go ahead and take one.... just one"", she returned her attention to the Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef treat and took it over the others.  Just to ensure it wasn't an uneducated selection I repeated this ""game"" three more times over the next couple of days and the results were always the same.  I'm convinced... she really likes these treats.  Last night I opened her treat bin and selected another treat for her.  She nudged past the treat in my hand and went for the bag containing the Bit-O-Luv treats.  These are the perfect size for training or reward treats even thought they seem somewhat small for our 95 pound adopted German Shepard mix.  It seems size doesn't matter when they like them.... I'm thinking I will be able to get her to do some chores around the house if I promise her these treats as a reward.  I don't think anyone will be disappointed in this quality product."

However, my female cat, Akira, has NO issues with it at all.<br /><br />Grandma's Chicken Soup- An epic fail for Puppy. He hates it, and refuses to eat it. I don't know if it's because of how liquidy it is, or if there's a smell he isn't so into... but he hates it.  Akira loves it and can't get enough... not sure how helpful this is, but I can say that if your cat prefers to lick their food instead of biting at it, you probably won't have a lot of success with this one, because Puppy licks his food and Akira bites hers.<br /><br />Polynesian BBQ - my least favorite of all the waruva products. It smells really strongly of fish (yuck) and is congealed... it's like jello. I have to fork it out of the can and mash it up in order to get Puppy to eat this.<br /><br />Peking Duckin was an overall success with both cats<br /><br />The Eggs and Chicken - Puppy would not eat the peas but Akira would (although she had some diarrhea after this.. but I think the eggs may be the culprit).<br /><br />Steak Frites- was hands down the favorite for both cats. It also contains pumpkin so I prefer to give it to Akira since she seems to have more issues with getting the runs.<br /><br />Those were the notable of the flavors our cats have tried. I hope this is somewhat helpful to you. Overall I recommend going with paw lickin chicken and steak frites."

Let's try them.""  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, ""lightly"" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.  Now I've only used it once, but I predict that the next time my dogs (chihuahua excepted) see me holding the by now familiar container, there'll be a stampede of sorts.

I remember it being in powdered form in small foil lined bags with simple flavors like lime or cherry.  This is leaps and bounds away from that stuff.  It probably has less sugar too since you don't have to add your own.  What I like about this product is that the cap doubles as a measuring cup.  It works good yet you have to knock all the mix into the pitcher and make sure it is all in there or else the mix particles will get caught in the tracks of the cap and it won't fit as tight as it once did.  So far, no problems with that though and the cap isn't too loosened but if a person wasn't paying attention, it could be a mess.  The taste of the product is very good.  I could imagine this would be even better in the summer, then drinking it now.  The peach and mango flavors taste natural.  I would recommend it to people who want an easy to make drink mix they don't have to add sugar too or even find a measuring cup for.  Just get a pitcher, add water and ice, stir and it's done!  I wanted to say I mixed this with the suggested amount of product to water and had a good, sweet but not too sweet, result and a good tasting peach mango drink.

No, you should not just grab handfuls of this stuff out of the bag like I did if you care about how much you consume. Measure it people. I suggest, if you're tracking your calories like I am, to avoid entering how much you consume, because the numbers will only depress you if the carb monster in you comes out to play.

Then again, they're sweet for me because I haven't really had sugary things in a while, so this was like a huge treat that I totally abused.<br /><br />The nice part is that there is plenty of fiber and omega 3's in this snack, so your blood sugar levels won't spike.

They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (10g protein, 3g fat, 8g carbs.). The Hickory Smoked variety is very flavorful with a little bit of a spicy kick.

I LOVE cookies (who doesnt??) but am kinda picky about texture. I dislike soft mushy cookies although if desperate...but I know that ""snap"" cookies are usually not soft so I took a chance and ordered a case!  I live alone so a case of cookies was, at once, both frightening and decadent---but I think I am going to have to order another case!  Everyone who tasted these asked me ""so where did you find these?""  Of course, since I am the online shopper from hell, everyone figured I found some obscure website and paid a fortune. ""Natural"" and ""Organic"" are buzz words for ""gonna cost ya more"" but the price was great per bag. After I told my friends and family who tasted them that I ordered a case---the bags started disappearing pretty fast! I got hit with guilt---What are YOU going to do with 12 bags of cookies? (duh--eat them!) and everyone was very happy to lighten up my stash by taking a bag so I dont overeat! Dont I have the BEST friends and family??? LOL  Seriously--I was happy to hand them over! I enjoy turning people on to new finds. I gave a bag to my Parcel Post guy and my UPS guy (after all--they lug all the boxes to my apartment!) and they were happy! And there is a method to my giving-away madness (especially to the carriers)! Less dropping and throwing around of MY boxes!<br /><br />Ok--they are nice and lemoney (?) but they could even be a bit more lemon-like for me! They are made with more healthful ingredients (no trans-fat) so even though I am pigging out on cookies--I dont feel nearly as guilty! And at less than $2 a bag--I think they are a greal deal! Plus it never hurts to have extra cookies in the house because a cookie emergency can happen at any given moment!  So--order them!  I think you will be pleased!"

The directions are in Japanese but you can view the video on youtube and they are pretty much step by step.  The box also has pictures on the back which help to some degree to follow but if you are not familiar with the video, it might be difficult.<br /><br />The video shows something like a cupcake liner that is silver and the person squeezing the peach stuff into it.  The kit does not come with a cupcake liner, so if you are purchasing this for a child who has watched the video make sure to get the silver candy/cupcake liner.  There is not a spoon included in the kit like the video and the container holes are kind of small, we just flipped the fork around to stir.<br /><br />Regarding taste, I did not think it tasted good at all but it was worth it to get for the experience.

The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />Coconut Cream Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to!<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll<br />3 Stars<br />This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie<br />3 Stars<br />This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called ""Cashew Cookie"", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was ""Where's the coconut?!"" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving."

I did switch a few times between brands but always stuck to milk based after breastfeeding. My son didn't seem to mind the switching, he seems to not be picky at all.<br />I like it because you get 1.5 the amount you would get with the other name brand formulas for the same price.  It's also not as bottom of the line as the generic brands and I like to keep a few companies in business instead of letting low prices become a monopoly.<br />When I mix the formula with water I swirl it around instead of shaking up and down.  It mixes well for me but for some reason when my husband mixes it, it ends up chunky..  I think it needs to be swirled immediately after scooped into the water and it will mix fine.  the longer it sits unmixed the more chance to get chunky."

B0026KPDG8,A4JHEO7H330AF,Tom Brody,1,1,5,2012-01-24,"Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!","POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product."

It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!"

B009M2LUEW,A3I937JLTEQSLL,iix,0,0,5,2010-04-18,Acquired Taste for Non-Diet Drinkers,"I haven't drank diet soda for many years and back then it was the nasty aspartame stuff.  Those drinks are an acquired taste but once you're off the corn syrup it's hard to drink a `regular' soda.  Zevia sodas also have a period where you'll have to get accustomed to the taste.  This is the third flavor of Zevia I've had up until the cola flavor I just got my hands on it was my favorite.  I was getting used to the stevia sweetened zing on earlier flavors of orange and black cherry before I got the root beer.  It tasted really good to me when I first started drinking it but it took my wife a bit more time to realize it was good.  She had stayed away from Zevia after tasting the orange which she did not like.  Zevia sodas still have a little aftertaste (the zing I refereed to above) that kind of sits with you for a few seconds but the longer you drink it the more used to it you get.<br /><br />However, there are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Root Beer is a very good tasting soda.  I'll definitely continue to drink it if I can afford to and Amazon has it available."

The one ounce bags are perfect for on the go and the ""mini"" version allows the consumer to pop the entire chip in the mouth with no mess.  The packaging looks (dare I say it) more sophisticated and ""adult like"" so you won't feel embarrassed to tote one around in your brief case (no orange tigers lurking around with artificial colors or flavors).  This blend between a chip and cracker taste quite good all in its own right but it is also great with dips and cheese.  I really enjoyed it and hoped the kids would hate it so that I'd have more for myself.....sadly, not the case.  This multigrain chip was a hit."

It is really fantastic on fish and plain old fashion pork chops, Oh I forgot pot roast in a crock pot is to melt in your mouth with real flavor.  I just wish the store I purchased it would still carry this product.  I have been looking all over for it and they always just carry the basic Creole line.

It is one of the few foods that once I start eating, I simply cannot stop until I either run out of them or I founder.  Hot or cold, I love them.<br /><br />Alas though, I am no longer allowed to eat them.  My physicians and my wife conspired against me (Well, my body did too...it really let me down), and they all monitor what I eat quite closely.  They have even brought my kids and grandkids into their repressive ring of food police.  Curses.<br /><br />When I get separated from my wife at the grocery store she never has to notify the manager.  She always goes to the pop-tart shelf where she will find me gazing longingly at the wonderful displays and fondling the boxes.  She gently but firmly leads me away...sigh.<br /><br />In the big scheme of things, these little gems are really not all that unhealthy for normal people.  My problem is that I am not normal.  I could probably get buy with it if I could only eat one now and then.  For me that is impossible...I simply can not stop.  This is odd because I am actually a pretty disciplined individual with an iron will...not with these though...they are my bane.<br /><br />The last time I had one of these delights was about a year ago.  My wife was gone and I found a box of them in the very back of one of our pantries.  I opened a pack and was blissfully stuffing my face when suddenly she came through the back door.  I quickly crammed the half eaten tart in the little bag and slipped in under the edge of my chair.  I fear to report to you that my beloved and faithful dog Brodie ratted me out and started snuffling and scratching and instantly my wife knew what was up.  It was heart breaking and humiliating.  She sarcastically retrieved the half eaten tart and gave it to the dog...right in front of my eyes!<br /><br />Anyway, these things are the best.  I love them and dearly wish I could pig on them again.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"

I don't like the fact that it has potatoes in it but the over all carb count is still relatively low.  I would prefer if my cat ate only wet food but I have tried countless times to get her to eat canned food and have not had any luck until recently (except with fish which she LOVES but I try to give her only rarely). One point to remember with this food is that it is much higher in calories than the crap-filled stuff so it's not wise to free feed with this food. I've always free fed my cat yet she gained some weight on this food her first few weeks. Now I'm giving her measured portions so that she doesn't eat too much.

Perhaps the treats leave some sort of residue in the dog's mouth and on their teeth to prolong the effectiveness. I thought the treats smelled rather strongly of beef stock, though the ingredients list natural chicken flavor, rosemary, parsley, and vanilla among other things. The ingredient list is not too long and are all natural. I've found my Cockapoo to have a rather sensitive stomach and these treats do not upset his digestive tract.

My brother hates coconut water,but loves this stuff. This drink is not too sweet,and has the perfect balance of pureed pineapple and natural coconut water subtly mixed together. I like vita coco's fruit infused waters as well, but find that this drink is a lot smoother in texture, and slightly more refreshing on a hot summer day."

Found the El Yucateco sauces (green, red, XXXtra hot, Chiptole) at a local store- so I bought one of each. Green is mild, red has more spices and good heat, and the XXXtra hot is as advertised - great long lasting burn! The Chipotle is the least favorite -too sweet for my tastes. (La Costena chipotles make a great pureed smoky/chipotle sauce.)  Haven't seen the Carribean sauce yet - I still would have to try it even though it gets bad reviews. I buy the Red & XXXtra sauces for the crew at my workplace. We go through a bottle per week of each. Great tastes and good heat.!!!!"

A representative of Greenfire and I worked together and came up with 60 different Olympics-related fortunes and I ordered three pounds of them. My staff loved them. I brought them to a meeting at the start of the day, and we spent almost as much time reading the fortunes to each other as we spent working. After the meeting, I left them out for the staff go nibble away at, and by the end of the night, all three pounds were gone.

Obviously there are no health benefits and the broccoli comes dried in a little packet so there's not much to be expected, but if you like Velveeta and broccoli give this a try! I love it.

The Kool Aid man has been and remains a giant threat to liberty and freedom.  He was originally designed in the late 70's and early 80's to undermine free societies the world over.  He is usually filled with red `Kool Aid', red for communism and he intended to flood our cultures with that oppressive red liquid.  Furthermore, he is characterized as someone for whom no wall can stop.  He was specifically designed to burst through the Berlin Wall and end democracy in the western world.<br />His original plan failed.  But that is not the end of the threat.  Kool Aid is manufactured in Mexico.  That is right people, the wall defeating menace is poised on our very borders.  Imagine the immigrant problem we will have when our border walls (like in Arizona) are turned into swiss cheese.  And as if that were not enough, now he has developed camouflage!  Now he is an invisible wrecking ball of doom for our borders, our children, and our very way of life.  The Kool Aid man, like all truly dangerous foes, commands my grudging respect.  While I salute your cleverness and tenacity, I will not rest until your mask has been removed and all see you for the threat you are.  I long for the day when your plans are derailed.

I usually like darker chocolate, but for some reason, the milkiness in this is perfect. The inside part is this deliciously tart candy that is kind of the consistency of a jelly bean (trust me, it works). It's definitely not real fruit (this is the case for the acai version as well). It's some kind of juice concentrate mush. You shouldn't fool yourself into thinking these are ""antioxidant healthy."" They're really just a treat. A whopping 180 calories for 1/4 cup treat.

B005QRPH78,A2V0H5HIN4OWKN,The book lady,0,0,5,2011-11-01,Jilly Loved It,"I have to start out by saying that I don't like it ""fancy or gourmet"" dog products. Dogs will eat just about anything, except for broccoli and carrots with my baby Jilly, and to get some item when you are paying mostly for either package design or brand name isn't something I buy into being that stuff impresses me, not her.  That being said I did like this product and more importantly Jilly loved it.  These have the same X shape as a dentastix, so I have to assume it would help getting rid of some plaque buildup, although there are no claims on the package.  The cinnamon and spice flavor was potent enough that I could smell it when I opened the package, which I liked, being I knew what she is getting.  And even though the flavor might be more for me than for Jilly, it sure is an improvement over liver flavors etc.<br /><br />Compared to similar products this was harder and took her more time to eat, which I liked.  It took her about 8-10 minutes and a lot of similar type products she eats in just a few minutes.  All that being said, I really did enjoy the product for what it was, but I am not so sure about any weight loss or health benefits.  The L-Carnitine proudly displayed on the front of the package, right next to the antioxidants came off as something like lycopene does for people.  Sure it's good for you and you should eat more of it but when you do do you honestly notice a difference in the way you feel?  As to the weight loss aspects, my dog is only about 8 months old and she's normal weight, but a bit husky being she's a lab. She has some small milk dud sized treats that are her absolute favorites that are 3 calories each and a handful would have less calories than this bone, if weight was an issue and Jilly prefers a natural bone (real bone not rawhide) and it takes her a LONG time to eat and I can't believe the amount of calories she gets per preserving is more than 92.<br /><br />Basically, for what it is it's a very good product, that being said there are most likely better options out there if you aren't willing to spend money on the nice smell and nice packaging.  I'm not sure if I would order it again, but maybe being I like to give her a verity in treats being she eats the same old same old kibble.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars."

It's most noticeable for me at the gym as I have a lot more strength and stamina when I'm working out. Another plus is that I have a much more consistent appetite than before. That's a good thing for me and I definitely feel the urge to eat more than I used to...maybe the cleansing effect of all of the extra fiber? I also sleep better too even with the extra energy.<br /><br />I do two scoops with 25oz of water in the morning and two scoops with dinner. The packaging recommends 1-3 per day. You can mix it with shakes, juice, etc, but I don't mind the Earthy flavor. The powder doesn't dissolve entirely so I suggest getting a Blender Bottle so you constantly mix it. It's also convenient for when you're on the go...throw in scoop or two, add water and you're out the door.<br /><br />I really can't recommend this product enough, but please don't think that this is some cure-all if you plan to eat junk food, smoke, drink a lot, etc. However, if you're trying to live healthy and want to improve your energy levels then this is definitely worth giving a try."

She is on an Immunosupressant Allergy Treatment, but it only treats environmental allergies.  In addition to 3 types of pollen, dust and grain mites she is also allergic to Rice, Yeast, Corn, Wheat, Beef and Horse.  I couldn't find a single store brand (non-prescription) dog food, until this one, that has none of the ingredients that she is allergic.  I can attest to the quality of this product since her allergies are VERY severe and the slightest amount of rice or beef and she would break out in hives and chew her paws until they bleed.  She is also very sensitive to grain mites and since the dog food comes sealed, this is an excellent preventative measure.  There is not a whole lot the manufacturer can do for grain mites once the bag is opened, aside from starting with quality ingredients, so I still recommend storing the food in a sealed container out of the heat/moisture if this is a problem for your dog as well.  Freezing it is another good option which is what I do since my house is very damp (she doesn't mind it cold).  I have tried other Hypo-Allergenic and Limited Ingredient dog foods before this one and this is the only one that my German Shepperd isn't allergic to."

Lahvosh as bread on the table with a little smear of butter is a special treat.  It is great with soft cheeses and wine.  I will definitely buy again."
B001EQ4I5M,A3EULRICUY6WO7,B. Hamilton,0,0,5,2009-09-15,Yummy.,I enjoy many of the flavored Millstone coffees.  My groceries recently stopped carrying the Caramel Truffle so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  I believe the price per package comes out the same or slightly better than your local discount world if you throw it in on an order with free shipping.  I only drink decaf when pregnant or nursing and I love all of Millstone's decaf selection.

B001AHJ2FQ,A2BXMHV2B0QRCM,K. Robertson,2,2,5,2008-08-25,Delicious and healthy tortilla chips,"I have been on a quest for a number of years now to eat foods that provide good nourishment to my body without sacrificing taste and satisfaction.  I immediately loved these chips when I tried them -- sometimes ""healthy"" foods have to grow on you, but not so with these chips.  They come in a nice little pentagon shape, and there are about 16 chips in the bag, which is just right for a snack or to combine with a sandwich for lunch.  If you are watching your calories and fat, it is great that they list the nutritional information for the whole bag and not for 1/2 bag like some companies do.  All the ingredients in these chips are ones that you see on those lists of ""healthy foods you should be eating.""  All the flavors meld together to make a really nice, rich flavor that is ever-so-slightly sweet, and you get a light taste of flax and sesame seeds.<br /><br />I compared the label with Doritos Toasted Corn Tortilla Chips, and these Multigrain Chips have 3 times the fiber, 2/3 the sodium, 1/2 the saturated fat, and of course the much healthier ingredients, with no trans fats.<br /><br />These are the best chips of the many I have tried that use healthy ingredients, and I'll be definitely ordering more of them."
B001SITYJ6,AEHBF6X3ASN0W,Fred Madden,1,1,5,2010-04-15,Best ever,"I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have ""turned on to"" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet."

This box contains packs where each original cracker is half size (think s'more size without having to break them). We typically would open and eat what was in the pack.  The weight on this box is less than the weight on the long cracker box but there is less waste because they are in a more convenient size and you aren't opening way more than can be eaten, so they aren't going stale.  If you have a smaller sized household or just can never seem to break your crackers in half perfectly for s'mores then these are great."

I love them all although the sour apple is indeed ""sour"". It will make your mouth pucker which I personally love but I buy the strawberry & tropical flavors for my children.

My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)"

Better yet you get the intensely rich flavor of the habanero pepper and it's sweet, but not sugary and you don't feel the need to add salt either. I grow several varieties of Habanero, chocolates, ghost, heirloom, and Scotch Bonnet Red and Jamaican Giants as well as Tabasco, Jalapeno and Thai chilis. I'm even growing the Bhut jolokia this year. They all go well with Pimiento a mild meaty sweet pepper and make great sauces for pork chicken and fish.

The tea is smooth, subtle, complex and richly satisfying, with a balanced leafy and floral flavour and the lightest hint of smoke.  It's the kind of tea that you can really explore with your taste buds, and I find it completely satisfying on its own, without any dessert accompaniment.<br /><br />A bit of milk and sugar bring out the flavour, especially if you brew it strongly.<br /><br />Since Twinings discontinued Russian Caravan (at least in Canada), this has become my favourite Twinings tea.  If you like keemun, you'll like this tea.  If you can't find Prince of Wales, then just get a good keemun."

B000AQFQC6,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,"K. Corn ""reviewer""",13,14,5,2006-03-11,"Finally, a GREAT substitute for noodles and pasta! And here's the calorie info...","I agree with the reviewer who gave these a stellar rating. We've tried a variety of pasta and noodle alternatives (spaghetti squash etc) and the results ranged from interesting to...terrible. The spaghetti squash was the best alternative but it certainly didn't taste like regular pasta. But regular pasta plays havoc with our blood sugar and whole wheat pasta wasn't to our liking...so we continued our search.<br /><br />These Tofu Shirataki Fettucini are the absolute alternative to pasta which we've found and they are very tasty. I noticed that one person here said they were ""tough"" and ""inedible"". NOT TRUE. Also, they have only 40 calories per package and one package was certainly enough to be a generous serving for me (it might take two packages for someone with a hefty appetite). I tested my blood sugar before and after eating these, both within an hour of eating them and several hours later. My blood sugar stayed nice and level, so there was that benefit as well.<br /><br /> As far as texture goes, they ARE closer to an ""al dente"" (a bit chewy) pasta than an overcooked, mushy pasta but we'd always preferred our pasta a bit on the ""al dente"" side. If you don't like ""chewy"" you might not like the Tofu Pasta. That didn't bother us one bit.<br /><br />True, the taste is not identical to pasta but we both felt that (like most tofu) it picked up the taste of whatever we put on it and any remaining taste was subtle, in our opinion.<br /><br /> The first time we ate it we put on homemade tomato sauce, fresh Parmesan and oregano and basil (fresh basil) It was yummy! The second time we made spaghetti (canned sauce and ground beef and freshly chopped spices) and it was also delicious. I then experimented with various sauces, from those with a sour cream base to creamed cottage cheese and a bit of butter and green onions. Every time, the result was delicious - and what a calorie savings over regular pasta.<br /><br />  We have not eaten them plain or buttered, like regular noodles or pasta. I have a feeling the texture might be more noticable then and there might be a subtle taste that would be different from pasta.<br /><br />  This is as detailed and clear as I can be. We were absolutely DELIGHTED to discover and use these and found them to be the best substitute by far for our favorite pasta (although we're certainly open to suggestions for others).<br /><br />PS: Since writing my original review, I wanted to note that I adapted a sweet noodle kugel recipe using these as the ""noodles"". It was delicious. For anyone who might be interested in doing the same, I did NOT bake the kugel like you do a traditional one. I simply used Light Sour cream, cinnamon and Splenda to make a kugel that would work for diabetics or those on a diet. I did heat the noodles in the microwave after draining them because they do tend to leak liquid even when they are heated up without any. I added the other ingredients to the hot noodles and heated gently on the stovetop. Leftovers were eaten cold."

Even with the coconut flavor that people seem to love, I could not finish the box.  I just got the chocolate mint jocolate bars and I love them.  I think the coco cuts the sweetness a lot.  I also like the dryer texture of these rather than the sticky texture of the fruit bars.  The same things I like about these bars the one star reviews seem to really dislike, so it seems like it is all about preference.  I don't like things that are super sweet.  I think milk chocolate is gross, and when I eat chocolate I prefer 85% coco or above.  So, maybe those things will be helpful to gauge if you will like these or not."

I frequently use Illy coffee in my Gaggia machine to make espressos, cappucinos, lattes, and so on so I'm very familiary with the brand and their coffees.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed this beverage first chilled then served over ice.  The perfect blend of coffee, 2% milk, and cocoa powder, were excellent but seemed to be a mocha rather than a cappucino.  My home-made cappucinos are frothy where this was not.  I'm puzzled by the ""do not shake"" statements printed on the can.  I would think that shaking the beverage in the can would froth it up a bit to make it more cappucino-like but they must have their reasons for not wanting it to be shaken before opening.  Regardless, this is a very good coffee drink that I will be enjoying more of in the future.  I hope you will enjoy it as well."

You need one of the individual metal coffee sieves that can be purchased at any Vietnamese grocery for $2-3. It takes 20-30 minutes for the coffee to completely drain after you add the boiling water. You then add sweetened condensed milk to taste. Most of the Vietnamese drink it with ice, but you can drink it hot if you like. It is like expresso with a very strong hint of chocolate, making it quite yummy."

A huge plus is that the mix is both economical and simple to prepare. Fixing perfect red beans and rice is as simple as boiling water with a little oil, adding the mix, and letting it simmer for twenty-five minutes. Then Voila! Perfect, yummy, delicious, mouth-watering food straight from the bayou country. Although perfect by itself, there are so many ways to jazz this simple but yummy fare up. Add sauce piquant (hot sauce), or throw in sausage (a big hit last Sunday with my dinner guests), or throw in diced tomates, chicken, pork, beef, shrimp......whatever left-overs you have in the fridge....it doesn't really matter as most things taste better mixed in with red beans and rice. So: it tastes great, is easy to prepare, it's dirt cheap, and can make you look like a culinary genius to your friends. Five stars all the way! There are different brands out there including Goya, Zatarins, Lipton, Vigo, Zatarains etc. but I think you can always safely buy the less expensive version without sacrificing any quality, but maybe you should sample the different mixes yourself and draw your own conclusions. I cover my red beans and rice with lots of hot sauce so I may be covering up some sins. If I had to pick though I generally get Vigo's if it is available. It's the one I am most used to."

If you have a recipe for vegan cupcakes for example that tend to crumble, just add 1.5 teaspoons to the dry ingredients in your recipe and this just might fix the problem!

This is definitely a mocha, so coffee purists may not like it much. It has no aftertaste. Very smooth and rich flavor. After you kick your caffeine monkey, you will not miss coffee much with this alternative. So, it tastes great, rich, smooth, with no aftertaste, and it's economical. I'm going to try their mocha, which has no chilies in it. That should be just perfect.

We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.

I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]"

But just for today, I decided to go ahead and actually make them the way they're supposed to be made.  I have to say, it's a nice, refreshing flavor.  Limeade is great, but that subtle kick of mint does make it just a bit more refreshing.  And since I made them sans alcohol, as instructed on the package, I poured some for my 4 and 6-year-old kids.  I thought the mint might throw them off, but they both remarked right away that they loved it.  So go ahead, order it and make a pitcher - it won't go to waste.<br /><br />And on another note, I'm still planning to do a little experimenting to see if I can make a grown up version of this in a blender with some water, ice, and light rum."

Chop up one of these curry bricks, add water and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the vegetables are tender, thinning with water until the sauce is as thick/thin as you want. Serve over rice.<br /><br />It is cheap, easy, and a great way to get eat carrots if you don't really like them. We have that for dinner about 3-4 times a month.

At 1 minute to heat up the brewer & 1 minute to brew a fantastic cup of hot cocoa, you can't beat it.  A tip: stir your cup of cocoa occasionally while you drink it as some of the chocolate tends to settle out, and as a fellow chocoholic I'm sure you would hate to see any of that chocolate go to waste."

Even with my new healthy life the occasional cup is still out of the question as I'm now lactose intolerant. Figured my chocolate drinking days were behind me. And I was certainly skeptical about trying a tea based replacement when I stumbled across this. I'm not a tea drinker, at least I never was before, but cutting out all soda left me with just water and the occasional glass of fruit juice so adding tea is something I'm now doing for variety and the health benefits. And finding this chocolate tea has been a real treat! It tastes good!<br />At first sip, I wasn't sure, it was like a very dark bitter chocolate, maybe some like that, but not me. But when I added a packet of splenda to it...magic! I swear it was just like a cup of hot chocolate, so good I had to have a second cup! ^_^<br /><br />Even if I weren't lactose intolerant, or concerned with calories and sugar content of which this has none of either, I would still be drinking this.<br /><br />It's that good!"

I just ate a spoonful off of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E7S5BO"">Light My Fire Titanium Spork</a> and its great all by itself. I barely pull a burn from it. I highly doubt its 550,000 rating. My bottle of Mad Dog 357 is hands down at least 2x/3x as hot -- confirmed by testing just now in the same amount. I'm actually starting to wonder if there was some mistake or I got a fluke bottle of 357, because its the hottest thing I have aside from my Da' Bomb lineup. It literally sets my mouth on fire and feels more like about 650,000. I have and have eaten some Da' Bomb Final Answer and this is around half that heat or so I think. I don't have the collector's edition either.... Oh well, YMMV. Have fun chileheads!<br /><br />Update: I got the Mad Dog collectors edition in the mail today. It is twice as hot as the original so there that is. I also have Ultra Death sauce now too. Its not much hotter than the Mega Death that I can tell. I'm thinking that the Mad Dog line may be the truest to its claimed Scoville rating that I have come across. Everything else has been all over the board, no wonder you have to be careful testing sauces. Go hit some Ground Zero with 214,000(my ass) Scoville rating."

Perhaps Amazon will read this review and might consider selling them themselves and put in a price between 50 cents to $1.49 with Free Shipping and maybe the ""subscribe and save"" option. I checked around Amazon and found prices to really vary -------  for 3 boxes it varies from $4.13 to $7.49 a box, for 6 boxes $4.13.  And I am paying 50 cents to $1.49 a box."

Another reviewer commented about the rich aroma when the bag is opened, and she's right. The cocoa is a beautiful reddish-brown, and has the richest, most delightful smell ever. The only cocoa I found that remotely reminds me of this one is Schokinag. I found this at Williams-Sonoma, but it's priced much better here, even with shipping.  The only thing I have to say, to those who are not aware that there is a difference between Dutch Process and regular cocoa, is that you have to either watch the recipes you use it in or find a way to modify the recipe you have. I did the latter for the chocolate cake and it was wonderful. My brownies, which don't need modification came out so perfect that no one could believe that just changing the cocoa made that much of a difference.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product, and had I not bought enough from WS to last the holidays, I would be buying this last one available now. Someone needs to snatch it up quick!"

This MIO mango blend is very flavorful when used as either a hot winter time tea, or a cool summer drink.  It blends excellently with barely a stir or a shake and has a nice strong peach flavor to it.  It also is versatile in that it can be mixed in with plain yogurt for a flavorful and cheaper substitute for the already blended fruit varieties.  (You can just sprinkle it on top for even a stronger flavor, excellent). Finally, this container is the best design for a convenient tote along for ones purse or lunch bucket.  It seals tightly and stays fresh for a long time.

If you have an upset stomach, it settles it immediately.  I have an aunt who was hospitalized and unable to eat.  Her potassium levels were very low.  She was able to drink this and keep it down.

Its a bit tedious for weed eating and mowing, but worth it in that the landscaping is intact and I can stop worrying about them digging up the sprinklers underground.<br />This fence surrounds backyard plant beds and does a great job- my largest dog is a mastiff and it works to deter him too- give it a shot!"

Frankly, I could care less about what soap I had used in the past.  Bar, body wash, whatever was available, I'd use it.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but my biggest goal in the shower as a guy was to see how quickly I could get out.  Speed is the name of the game in the shower for me...no 5, 10 or 15 minute showers.  Get in and get out.  Just like at the mall.<br /><br />However, this body wash may have me extending my shower time.  It smells good, not ""nice"" but good.  Not manly per se, but not girly either. It lathers quickly and holds the suds.<br /><br />Now for the kicker.  I live in a dry climate and would always have to use lotion on my hands by the time I had gotten to work.  I haven't had to use it since I've been using this body wash!  Great news for me as I can kill two birds with one stone.<br /><br />All in all, I really could care less about my shower routine and how I smell coming out.

I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them.

I am using one scoopful a day in my morning coffee. At first I was skeptical, having tried the glucosamine products in the past, and found no relief. Gelatin (which is the main ingredient of Nutrajoint) was recommended by my doctor (with no guarantees of course ). I had been through physical therapy for my hips, followed by regular gym exercises for about 6 months with only minimal improvement. After about 3 weeks on Nutrajoint I started noticing a reduction in the frequency of hip joint pain episodes, even after relatively vigoruous physical activity. I continued to improve and now only experience discomfort in my hips infrequently compared to every week a few years ago. Nutrajoint is not a cure, but, combined with regular physical workouts, it has made living with hip arthritis alot easier. The only ""side effect"" I have noticed is that I am trimming my finger and toe nails more frequently ( of course, that indicates that Nutrajoint is doing its job !! )"

When we moved to a small town and I couldn't find Chicken Soup in any of the stores or even the one Feed Store in town, I bought 1 bag of a brand availible in the grocery store. Boy, if looks could kill! Frankie gave it one sniff, walked off a ways, sat down with his back to me, ears back he turned his head to me --- and his point was very clear... I got right on Amazon and ordered the largest bag of 'Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul'. I chose Chicken Soup initially because it had the highest fiber content of all the cat foods including the more expensive ones. All I knew then about required cat nutrition was the importance of fiber in the diet. The wild ""big cats"" will eat almost everything of what they kill - bone,nails,hoof,fur,tendons,cartlidge along with the soft muscle tissue and some of the internal organs. When I began to look at what most cat foods contained I couldn't beleive I was finding so many grain products in them. I've never seen a cat eat a bowl of corn meal or barley...What!<br /><br />We are all very happy. Frankie has been eating Chicken Soup for 4 of his 5 years and has never been sick, Goes to the vet only for regular checkups and immunizations. The Vet will always remark about how alert,and interested Frankie is in his surroundings. How strong and well muscled; heavy without being fat he is. Frankie is the love or our life (my husband's and mine) and we are thankful to the makers of Chicken Soup for Frankie's vigor,his delight and interest in the world surrounding him. He is playful,kind, making friends with all the neighbors, and is always eager to take part in what ever is going on around the house and yard. Our lives are inriched by Frankie and we beleive his abilities to beneficially influence us, comes from his good health, and his good health comes from Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul.  Many thanks."

Herbal teas get boring really fast; Teeccino is OK but after a while, ugh. The Italian roasted barley of Cafe Orzo tastes really great, satisfies me the way coffee did. Cafe Orzo recommends adding favorite flavoring; I add Toranio White Chocolate syrup. Result, really amazing flavor! Try it for yourself."

It made for great video when they were trying to get it off of the roofs of their mouths...this made 4 mini loafs and would have made 8 cup cakes. The frosting set up great when I put them in the fridge on the plates after decorating.

We gather round and put our own chosen beef, scallops, shrimp or chicken on it to quicly cook.  Of course, you would have to be old enough to understand it is hot enough to seriously burn you if you were to touch it so young children should not be allowed near it.  I find that thick Beef has to be prepared as thin strips or smaller pieces to be well done. It cleans up easy after it cools: just wipe it with a warm cloth of water and a little lemon juice and let it dry. The size slab you buy depends on the amount of food you want cooked at the same time.  We love it."

At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag)  BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag!  They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag.  I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties.<br /><br />One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving.  (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person)<br /><br />Favorites so far are:<br />Honey Mustard & Onion<br />Vintage Cheese<br />Classic Sea Salt<br /><br />I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities.  I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases.<br /><br />But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected."

My mouth waters just thinking about them. They are pretty chewy, but I've got a bunch of fillings and several crowns, and none of them have been pulled out by eating these so I guess that's a good sign! I think they are soft enough to be enjoyable by most. They are definitely MUCH softer than say, caramels, for example! I think the flavor is greater in these than in regular jolly ranchers. It's like they are infused with more fruit flavor. They are delicious!<br /><br />After trying them in the store, I ordered these off of Amazon and I was in love! You get a pack of 12 bags, which is great for the price. I went on several trips recently and just grabbed a bag to take with me each time.

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product.  When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom.

I mixed the flour with some spices and coated beef for beef stew and it turned out perfect.<br /><br />For people who are new to gluten-free and reading the negative reviews, remember that you are used to over processed gluten-full foods and mixes so not every gluten-free product may taste perfect at first. This one worked for me from the beginning, but other products weren't so great at first. Now that I'm more used to them, I enjoy the things I once disliked."

B000WFPPDK,ACCI2Z06VIHGI,Yvonne Grosella,4,4,5,2011-12-15,All three of my cat's rate it a BIG 10! 10! 10!,"Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She ""cautiously"" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says ""You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!"". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and ""no way!"" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage ""dining room"". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his ""Happy"" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to ""shop around"" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne"

THEN I decided to throw them on a pizza and bake it. OMG it was so delicious. I'm vegan, so it was a cheesless pizza with just peppers, onions and a ton of these on top with lots of olive oil. The flavor changed completely, it was divine! I also stir fried them in a little olive oil with red bell pepper and onion and made hoagies, again out of this world. The flavor you taste when they are microwaved gets baked in when they are cooked by other methods. I will be buying these forever. So, stick to prepping them in the microwave with a little water to make the sauce, let them sit for a about 5 minutes and then stir fry them in olive oil, bake them, forman them and you will find what a real true dish these make!"

They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day. I choose peanut butter just because I know my dog loves it and we don't have to get really messy with something like a kong or anything. The overall training has been going really well with these as I can take a handful and have more than enough left for each training session. I will say that the one thing is that they are small enough that you sometimes worry that the dog is going to bite your hand and not the treat so make sure to palm feed your dog and not try to pinch the food between two fingers.

He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!"

I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again"

I love the flavor, it's like spicy pepperoni without the meat. It's salty as well, and it's a great addition to a lot of sauces and italian dishes. I use it in pasta sauces, pizza sauces, and as a pizza topping. I put it in little dabs all over the pizza. Combine that with some prosciutto or pepperoni and it's amazing. I also put it on crackers and bread and mix with olive oil and other tapas/appetizer type stuff.<br /><br />I was a little worried when I ordered this that it would be more Asian style pepper paste because a couple of reviewers that characterized it as tangy and similar to Asian pepper pastes. I think that the only thing in common is they are both fairly hot and spicy. Asian pepper pastes and sauces tend to be very tangy and sweet and sour/acidic. This in contrast, is not very tangy or acidic, and definitely not sweet. It's spicy and salty."

Waggy Tails!,"Our poor little pooch (ok, ok ... a big ol slobbery mess) had some serious stomach issues since we moved to the city from 4 acres of freedom. We tried everything to help her adjust, including altering her diet. Adding small amounts of oatmeal and rice to her regular food helped, but we kept having to increase the portions. Eventually, she was eating too much people food, and not enough dog food. We knew it was doubtful that it was a medical problem because of prior history of stress induced digestive issues. Not only that, she always had a fussy stomach to begin with (already vet checked). Nonetheless, we were beginning to get worried.<br /><br />Finally, on a hunch, I visited a local family owned pet store down the street. The kid there obviously knew his stuff, and the products. I explained the situation, and he recommended California Natural. I never wanted to try this brand because of the price but I decided to trust him.<br /><br />Well, the problem cleared up completely in less than 2 days. There was very little, if any, transition period between her old food and California Natural. The, ahem, results (if you will) are now normal, occur less frequently, and compact (sorry to be gross.)<br /><br />At first, I was worried about the cost. I realize now, a resulting vet bill could cost far more. I am now looking at this as a preventative measure; an investment into her health and longevity. If we had started her on California Natural at the beginning, she probably wouldn't have the ""fussy stomach"" I mentioned earlier. Not only that, we might have saved countless dollars, hassle, discomfort, and emotional distress by avoiding trips to the vet.<br /><br />The food satisfies her, she loves it, and it is gentle on her stomach. And, I am told, it is healthy stuff. All I can say is - hallelujah!<br /><br />Thanks guys -<br /><br />- from Sandy the pooch<br /><br />(and us)<br /><br /> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XLVBU"">California Natural Lamb Meal and Rice Adult Dry Dog Food</a>"

It sure is, and that is exactly what it tastes like.  Read on :)  It's got electrolytes! YES! I am going to have to believe that because as I said, it tastes like water. I love the idea of electrolytes in anything and if you do too, then this is for you. Rather than feeling like you always have to grab a bottle of Gatorade (which is sugary, flavored, chemical-ish tasting) you can grab WATER! Perfect for after workouts, at work, any time!<br /><br />If you read the ingredients (purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride) you might wonder what all of that is doing in there. I do. But I'm not a scientist and not sure what makes up electrolytes. It has zero calories, fat, sodium (with sodium bicarbonate in it?) zero carbs, zero protein. So I'm going by what the bottle says, it's electrolyte water. Yeah!<br /><br />It's a huge bottle, one I plan to recycle by filling with water from my fridge! Which brings me to the other claim on the bottle. It says 'For a difference you can taste."" Well, to me, this tastes like my fridge water. No better, no worse, no different. I had actually considered taking off one star for this, but then I recalled my high school health class that said 'you can interpret sales/marketing one way ""This is the best toothpaste ever!"" or another. Who is to say what it's the BEST of? WHO says? Etc. So I can't taste any difference from my fridge water, like I can with my favorite waters <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013T5YO4"">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 50.7 -Fl.  Oz  Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S891KU"">NEO Water - 9.5pH Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Water 20 OZ (24 Case) - Alkaline Water - Electrolyte Water - Antioxidant Water - PH Water - BPA Free Plastic</a> but who is to say that's bad? But aha! It says on the bottle it has a 'silky smooth taste' Well, in my opinion, the Fiji water really, really does! This doesn't at all, but that could just be my opinion of what silky smooth water should be.<br /><br />SO if you love water, and want something added to it that will help you refresh, refuel, get better etc...and want it to just taste like water...then this is totally for you. At 50.7 fluid ounces, and with a nice sturdy bottle, you won't be disappointed."

I've tried other products for dogs containing glucosamine, but wasn't very happy about the animal products in them, because I know too much about where those animal products come from and how they're processed, and prefer not to feed them to my dog. (One reviewer of this product, wishing for a chicken or beef flavor, asked, ""What kind of dog eats salmon?"" The answer: mine, every day.  He loves it,and for twelve years old he's pretty darn healthy.)<br /><br />Unlike some of the dogs mentioned in other reviews, my dog loves the flavor of this.  The ingredients are exceptionally well thought out--they're not fillers.  For example, ginger and turmeric are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, but dogs may not particularly like them in their raw form. Omega-3 fatty acids are also effective.<br /><br />Does it help?  After two weeks, I'd say maybe; since my dog doesn't have a major problem, any change wouldn't likely be dramatic, but he doesn't seem quite so creaky.<br /><br />For a larger dog, the product, while reasonably priced considering the ingredients, can get a little pricey if you expect to use it consistently, and I believe with this type of supplement that's what you'll have to do if you want to get results and keep them. This 150-gram size will only last a few weeks. But I haven't found a better product of this type."

When I have eight hours of driving ahead of me, that's not the safest place to be.  Now, I knew that 5 Hour had the potential to keep me alert, because I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 and it had worked VERY well to keep me focused on house cleaning - why not driving?  Eyes drooping, halfway to Knoxville, I grabbed a 5 Hour Energy out of my purse and downed the thing.  I'll admit - the flavor isn't the greatest, and Orange and Pomegranate are the only flavors I've tried that I can tolerate.  However, within ten minutes I was alert, wide-eyed, singing along with the radio and finally appreciating the beautiful weather as I drove through the mountains.  5 Hour, you're a life saver!"

B001FKA2NY,A22O5OB5CZ23HV,Savvy Shopper,0,0,5,2012-02-03,Really? Quality Dog Food by Mail??,"Never thought I'd take advantage of my Amazon Prime membership by having my dog's food delivered to my doorstep. What can I say? It sure works for me! The bag arrives on time and in great condition.<br />  Let me preface this review by saying that I have never worked for or been associated in any way with the manufacturer or the distributor of this product. I am simply a discerning but thrifty dog owner.<br />  OK, down to brass tacks...ProPac High Performance Dog Food is worth every penny down to the last piece of kibble. My Golden is nine and a half years old and has been allergic her entire life to ALL the non-allergenic premium dog foods out there...with the exception of Propac, which is entirely made, from start to finish, in the US (and was never part of the melamine-laced dog food scandal several years ago that prematurely ended many dogs lives). Propac doesn't contain any of those dubious-quality ingredients you always find on pet food labels that are lumped under the catch-all term: by-products.<br />  With Propac, what you see on the label is what you get. No substitutions. Period. Chicken meal and fat, ground corn, flax seed, beet pulp, yeast culture and vitamin/mineral supplements. The ONLY preservative is vitamin E. Since my pooch isn't a 'working dog', she eats a fraction of whats recommended on the label. One cup twice a day maintains her svelte 75 lb figure. This dog food is a rare find nowadays: a reliable, quality product with the right price for my wallet.<br />  The best part? My dog(and every other canine fussy-eater I know who's wisely made the switch)goes absolutely WILD for this dog food. That NEVER happened with other premium brands...and these dogs have tried every one! The folks at Wells obviously know what they're doing, because this stuff stays fresh and palatable, from the first bowl to the last from every 33 lb bag.<br />  EVERYONE who touches my Golden is blown away by her incredibly soft, gleaming coat. Several weeks after my friends switched their four-legged family members to Propac, they discovered their dog's coats were likewise transformed from dull and dry to soft, luxurious and gleaming as well. No more flaky doggy-dandruff either! This is not my first dog and she surely won't be my last. I am very pleased to have discovered Propac High Performance and I will always feed my future dogs this quality product."

I bought these based on all the positive reviews as a desperate attempt to find something that would stop our female tabby from throwing up 2-3 times a day, every time she ate.  I've been giving both our cats 3 a day (less than the ""treament"" amount but more than the ""maintenance"" amount), and in the past month, the tabby has thrown up maybe 2 or 3 times total.  Our boy cat, who had hairballs more rarely (maybe one every other week), hasn't had a single one since they started getting these.  And they absolutely LOVE them!  They're moist and chewy, and I've been able to train them both to sit up on their back feet on command for these treats.  I hadn't held out much hope for these since we'd already tried Petromalt and had switched them to expensive hairball formula cat food, but I was definitely surprised at how well they work.  Go for Subscribe & Save to save some money -- a box of 10 packs every 6 months is just about perfect, and if you wind up with too many, you can always skip or delay a shipment."
B000CR41KG,A1GT5DGFJXLVLW,"JR Ewing ""happyGuy""",1,1,5,2010-11-01,Healthy and Loved by my dog,"I have three levels of treats and a few beloved dog toys that I use to reward my dog during training.  It's important to keep aside special treats and toys that are only used for important training moments - when you MUST have your dog's attention.  Trader Joe's cheapo brand for getting him to sit, MilkBone for when he responds to a ""Come"" command and Paul Newman treats to distract him when he meets other dogs.  My dog hates boxers for some reason.  The first night after we adopted him, he attacked my neighbor's Boxer in the hallway as my neighbors returned from a vet hospital visit - it was awful.  About a week later we had the dogs meet again - this time outside on neutral territory.  We made sure they met at a perpendicular, rather than head on, to minimize the chance of conflict.  My dog loves these treats so much that he didn't pay any attention to my neighbor's dog as she sniffed him.  We gave both dogs treats and brought them closer, praising each of them for good behavior and correcting any aggressive behavior immediately.  The Boxer was given her favorite squeak toy in addition to some of these treats and all ended well.  I always carry these treats on walks just in case I see another dog.  These are high quality, healthy, and my dog loves them - he jumps up and down every time he sees me grab the bag.  I don't just hand these out - these treats command attention and are reserved for exceptional behavior and when I need laser focus from my dog!"

Prior to this I had never baked  anything with yeast in it for fear that it wouldn't come out right.  Now, I refuse to pay for store-bought gluten free baked goods and so I must make my own.  But bread generally contains yeast, as does pizza dough and dinner rolls.  Pamela to the rescue!  The directions on the bag as well as the website are easy to follow even for a novice such as myself.  I have made several beautiful loaves of sandwich bread, cinnamon swirls, pizza and dinner rolls for Thanksgiving!  I am so grateful for an easy to use, tasty product.  I know that some felt the bread had an undesirable sweetness, but we have not noticed that and in fact used it for tuna sandwiches the other day.  I highly recommend this to anyone starting out on the gluten free journey.  I have also used it as an ""all-purpose"" gluten free flour in several cookie recipes with great success.  All-around winner for our family!<br /><br />ETA: We now use this as an all-purpose flour in many ""regular"" flour recipes and have not had any problems.  We have found the flavor of the bread to be bit flat.  To improve this, along with the water in the bread recipe, I add 3 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar.  This adds a bit of the sour flavor of regular bread.  To the pizza dough I add a bit of garlic salt and Italian seasoning."

When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!"

I hope Amazon will soon offer it on Subscribe and Save, because very few grocery stores in our area carry it.  I've been making soup from this mix for over 30 years -- great for 1 or 2, or large families, or even soup-loving company.<br /><br /> It's delicious just as is (follow extremely simple package directions), but it also takes well to modifications.  I often boil a picnic shoulder in a huge pot of water along with cabbages, potatoes, carrots and onions, making much more than enough for two full meals.  For the third and fourth meals, I use the defatted broth from the pot to make several quarts of pea soup according to package directions, then cutting up the remaining pork and vegetables and adding them to the soup.  A meatless version is also good, just with those same vegetables added to the soup mix (plus liquid smoke, if you like), whether it's made with plain water or vegetable stock.  I imagine chicken or fish would also work well.  And obviously you can use any types of vegetables.  Add any already cooked meat (if desired) or vegetables in the last 5 minutes just to warm them up (5 minutes after you put in the flavor packet); raw meat (if desired) or vegetables can be added nearer the beginning while the peas boil.  To really make the final product pop, top each serving with a dollop of non-fat or full-fat plain Greek yogurt, with or without a few drops of Frank's Red Hot or Tabasco With Garlic.  My husband and I served the vegetarian version of this to 160 people once, to rave reviews.  The meatless or the pork version also keep well in the fridge for reheating up to a week or more later.<br /><br />The best part is not having to soak or parboil the peas in a separate step, along with having the lovely aromatic flavor packet.  An easy, light, nutritious one-pot meal with fresh vegetables during a hot summer and a hearty, insides-warming delight with storage vegetables during a cold winter, all in one!"

B001LQCOIS,A48MEPDO9ZL26,Brooklyn Mom,8,8,5,2010-07-07,Worth every cent!!!,"I first used this product in 2005 when I lived in London and I used it until I moved to the US at the end of 2007 when my son was almost 3.  I found it to be absolutely invaluable.  My son never ate a jar of baby food - not once, because of this handy gadget.  All of his food for the first year was made in this and he was still eating food prepared in it when we left the UK.<br /><br />The pros for us was that it eliminated the need for 2 separate (and usually bulky) appliances (very handy in our Central London apartment) and it allowed us to prepare food for our son when we travelled which we did extensively.  This item travelled (and cooked) in Morocco, Amsterdam, New York, Washington DC, the Caribbean, the Alps and many other places.  Wherever there was an electricity socket we could use it.<br /><br />The best thing about it though is that this appliance is BPA and PVC (phthalate) free.  I know that many American parents are not as across this issue of toxic chemicals as the Europeans and the Canadians but it is a hugely important topic for young children.  Heating food in plastic is something you have to be very careful about, especially if you are feeding young children.  I'm simplifying this but in a nutshell BPA and phthalates have the ability to mimic the female hormone estrogen and interfere with the production of the male hormone (testosterone) amongst other things.  These chemicals are implicated in diseases such as breast cancer, testicular cancer, lowered sperm counts and defective sperm and diabetes.  Studies have shown that plastics, when heated, can leach (pass on) these chemicals.  Food and fluid heated in plastic containers or devices that contain these chemicals, will contain these chemicals in them also.  Chemicals that you (or your child) then eat.<br /><br />If your family eats lots of steamed vegetables etc then you will probably have a steamer that you are already using and I agree if you are steaming for a family then this is simply too small, but it worked perfectly for us and I would often steam food for us (spinach, baby carrots etc) from time to time.<br /><br />I never had a problem with mold or brown fluid!! (Also I am not sure you can blame an appliance for mold!)<br /><br />In a nutshell if you can afford it and want to make your own baby food, I cannot recommend this more highly.  I am pregnant again and am so happy that this is now available in the US.  I cannot wait to use it again."

I've been on something of a crusade to eliminate high fructose corn syrup from our diets, as well as unsavory chemical preservatives.  My five-year-old has always been a big fan of fruit snacks but I normally hate giving them to her as they are no healthier than candy.<br /><br />While I won't claim that these are 100% healthy, I can say that they are completely free of all the artificial and highly processed junk that goes into their cheaper counterparts.  Yes, they are pricier than other ""fruit"" snacks on the market but the higher price tag on these comes along with higher quality.  I'm more than willing to shell out the extra cash if it means that my daughter will be ingesting fewer chemicals and less corn syrup.<br /><br />What's more, my daughter not only loves the taste of these, I do as well.  Other brands have a very artificial too-sweet flavor while these taste like real fruit juice.  I was surprised at how good they are as I normally avoid fruit snacks because of the taste.  I also like the texture of these.  They are chewy but smoother and will dissolve in your mouth if you suck on them.

This is EXACTLY like those butterscotch hard candies from childhood!<br /><br />I think if I had to pick one matcha that I would never share with others this would have to be the one. Although there are so many I have yet to try I think so far this is my favorite. I just made myself laugh though because I have said that with almost every new matcha from Red Leaf Tea I have tried. Seriously though, this is so very yummy, and sweet, and just really the one that I feel will always hit the spot for me! What is even more cool is that when I mix it in my latte concoction - which is how I usually have my matcha, the butterscotch flavor comes out even more and is not by any means hidden underneath the milk or vanilla creamer!<br /><br />I always do try matcha straight before mixing it in my latte and I will say that the butterscotch flavor is stronger in the latte mixture than straight which I found interesting and odd at the same time.<br /><br />I don't know how Red Leaf does it but their flavors are all natural and while I certainly appreciate the health benefits to matcha I am finding I reach for it more and more simply for the flavor but I can't deny the excellent energy boost! Its like an energy drink without all the sugar which means you don't come down and fall on your face later in the day! This is a different kind of energy boost, one that makes you more alert and on the ball and it does not end abruptly finding yourself feeling lower than before you had the drink as energy drinks do. This trails off nicely and in a mellow fashion allowing you to ease into the afternoon or evening!<br /><br />I am now drinking at least one matcha per day, after my morning black tea!"

It makes a sweet counterpoint to the bitter stuff like the chocolate and the veggies. Yum.<br /><br />Supposedly, there are also a lot of health benefits to Yacon, and is a diabetic-friendly sweetener.

We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.

ICV D-47 strain was selected from 450 isolates collected between 1986 and 1990.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The ICV D-47 is a low-foaming quick fermenter that settles well, forming a compact lees at the end of fermentation. This strain tolerates fermentation temperatures ranging from 15° to 20°C (59° to 68°F) and enhances mouthfeel due to complex carbohydrates. Malolactic fermentation proceeds well in wine made with ICV D-47.<br /><br />Recommended for making wines from white varieties such as Chardonnay and ros&eacute; wines. An excellent choice for producing mead, however be sure to supplement with yeast nutrients, especially usable nitrogen.<br /><br />An excellent choice for dry whites, blush wines and residual sugar wines."

I normally prefer loose tea but the Tea India company doesn't use bags that become over-bloated with water, as do so many tea companies. The Tea India bags are generous enough in size so that the leaves have room to turn over and porous enough so that water can circulate through the leaves, allowing them to release their full flavor. Sorry Twinings Irish Breakfast and all of Barry's wonderful dark teas, you're going to have to move to the back of the cabinet as soon as my order from Tea India arrives."

She'll eat this any time of the day, and we're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  Also, our baby is a picky eater, so we're thrilled to find something she likes that's more substantial than Puffs!"

Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.

Apparently quite healthful, and the flavor also complements raw cacao well.<br /><br />FYI - I've read varying accounts about maca and it's health benefits. There seems to be a lot of support for the claim that maca is somewhat toxic in its raw form, and is more appropriately consumed in the cooked/gelatinized form? In addition, in the raw form it can have hormonal side-effects and is best taken 1) in the cooked form 2) with some other kind of additive to modulate that side effect. Apologies if any of this information is inaccurate, I know it IS second-hand. I just figure it's important to research the subject thoroughly on your own before you dive right out on a limb.<br /><br />And FWIW I have experienced no adverse side effects thus far from taking maca raw. No gastric distress, nausea, etc. and nothing weird or PMS-y, so maybe it affects different people differently.<br /><br />Good luck whatever you choose! :)"

Their mission - bring him to justice.<br /><br />After weeks of searching in the hot Pakistani desert, they had finally located his mansion.  Inside, lay 20 or 30 guards.  The Navy Seal team approached but their dry throats kept them from being able to talk to each other.  That's when Navy Seal Team Commander Jacob Michaels commandeered an old barely functioning pump.  The sludge water was deadly toxic to people even to Bear Grylls and his pee drinking self.  Desperate, they opened their 10 quart tea mix, poured some in - and out came rainbows and goodness that the world has never seen before.  The seal team drank their magic tea elixir and continued on their mission.<br /><br />As they approached the house one of the Pakistani guards noticed the team, and called an alert.  20 bearded men started shooting randomly at the exposed seal team.  But by the grace of Lipton, the commander tossed his can into the middle of them, which exploded into a cloud of choking biohazardous gas.  8 of the Pakistanis died instantly, and the dust cloud made it easy for the Seal team to get inside.  Shouting FIRE IN THE HOLE three more canisters were tossed into the compound, blinding and choking most any living thing in the area.<br /><br />When breaking into Bin Laden's room, the Seals, now down to the last of their 6 cans, decided to hold back their can to help provide cover in case of a fire fight.  Breaking down the door, the commander - firearm in one hand, tea mix in the other, screamed DEATH TO BIN LADEN! and started firing.  Bin Laden fired back, shooting the can, which exploded into awesome particles of win, which surrounded him and suffocated him.  On his dying breath, the tea mix kicked him in the groin and shouted ""USA BITCH!""<br /><br />The tea mix residue on the Navy Seal uniforms sped up the growth rate of their manly chest hair and beards, making them easy to spot - the handsome rugged bearded men of Seal Team Six.<br /><br />After being flown out of the area, all the hot British chick soldiers were so turned on by the smell of tea around the Navy Seals that they all started stripping which led to a massive orgy.<br /><br />This is why Lipton tea is the best tea anywhere and why buying anything less than a 6 pack makes you a pansy."

We make large batches on the weekends and having multiple trays allows us to make a variety of foods that we can then combine when defrosted during the week.  I love that they stack neatly in the freezer, have a lid (which a lot of other baby food trays don't have), and the frozen portions pop out easily.  Another reviewer wrote they use it as a serving tray for baby instead of many bowls--I will most certainly try that when baby is ready to feed herself.<br /><br />As a tip...the lid isn't completely airtight (as other mentioned) so I wouldn't recommend leaving the food in the tray until you're ready to serve.  We pop food portions out after freezing over night and store in labeled bags.  This is very handy for grabbing foods quickly."

I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less.

(Crystal Light, Lipton, 4C, and store brands such as Target)<br />Most sugared iced tea drink mixes are too sweet for my tastes as I do not drink brewed teas with any sweetener.<br />I prefer the splenda sweetened inced tea mixes over the aspartame, as it does not mess with my body as much and I refuse to drink anything with High Fructose Corn syrup any more.<br /><br />I started out with the 4C iced tea mix several years ago because I found it at a local Walmart, but they stopped carrying it. Then my local Target had their Market Pantry version of iced tea with splenda, it was good but did not dissolve well and they stopped carrying it. I tried going back to 4C purchasing it through their website, but it is almost cost prohibitive for someone who wants to drink iced tea daily.<br /><br />I tried the Lipton and it just tasted odd to me, more chemically contrived than tea flavored. I was not impressed. Yet I will drink the sugar sweetened Pure Leaf version in the glass bottles.<br /><br />After scouring the internet for a less expensive alternative, I found the Arizona brand. Since I was skeptic I read about it on the Arizona website, read product reviews here and I ordered it. Since I am a Prime customer I had it in two days, and much to my delight, it tastes great. I suspect it would be even better if I had access to ice in my house because I like my tea, slightly more diluted, but it tastes great as it is. I am impressed.<br />Both the stix and the cups dissolve well. The stix to not leave a sticky mess at the top of a bottle when you put the mix in 16.9oz bottle like so many mixes do. With the cups, I pour water in half way a bottle, put in the mix, shake it then add more water and shake again.<br /><br />I like this product and will buy it again as it does not break the budget and tastes great."

She would warm it up on the old gas stove.  You'd think that all of the major brands of ""pancake syrup maple flavored,"" would stop using high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />One day last week I had the chance to take my granddaughter out grocery shopping with me.  Not one of my best things to do, but I thought, how would she learn to shop and look for the good stuff, not the crap that's advertised on television, but the products that really work and the one's that are good for you.  Reading the labels is a major chore as what you thought was in the product wasn't even close to being in the product. Somebody has to teach her and it was my lucky day.<br /><br />Take for example, pancake syrup or what used to be called maple syrup in my day.  You look at the labels, today... never is there mention of a maple tree, not even close, all fructose or high fructose corn syrup.  So, I told her that maple syrup comes from sugar maple tree sap that has the water content reduced and I asked her if she could find a reference to a maple tree in the contents.  Well, you know the answer, there isn't any on the major or store brands.<br /><br />I told her that Coombs makes a maple syrup that reminded me of when I was growing up.  Well, after a few grocery stores later and checking their stock we came across the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Now, I know, I've been telling my granddaughter about how I grew up, so she wasn't going to let me off the hook so easily.  You guessed it... I made pancakes and we used the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup, warmed up on the stove just like grandma did.  She said, ""That's the best Maple Syrup I've ever tasted.""  I told her that's because it's real maple syrup.<br /><br />A lesson learned, and I was pleased to make pancakes for my granddaughter, this is one of those moments you don't forget in life."

Santos ""High-Maintenance""",7,7,5,2008-02-29,"Super Gummi Cola, Super Taste & Super Savings!","First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true! If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know, and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Super Cola Bottles, are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in a delicious cola flavor and a cute soda bottle shape!  These are the smaller pieces of candy, like the bears and not the very large cola bottles that can also be found in the five pound bag as well. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a ""chocolate-type candy"" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh,delicious and full of flavor.  To keep<br />them this way, I put them into two different ""freezer type bags"" and of course, I kept some out. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK. I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact cola bottles that you get there, without the worry that everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi super cola bottles, they are a sweet<br />and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more cola bottles, plus a few different kinds of other gummis as well.  Simply because, we all have our favorites!"

I liked it (even plain!) and tried to find this brand in my local grocery store. Didn't find it there, but found the Lavish Chocolate here on amazon. It was the least expensive of the flavors so I thought I'd give it a try.<br />I love the way each oatmeal packet becomes a measuring cup for your water. Very easy to prepare. Take note: you must use a microwave. You cannot prepare by just adding boiling water.<br />The chocolate flavor was very pleasant. Not overly sweet and not too bitter of a dark chocolate for my children to enjoy it. The oats looked and tasted better than other instant oatmeal brands. Plus the added bonus of flax seeds. I will be keeping a box of these in my drawer at work for easy breakfasts or healthy snacks.<br /><br />I finally did find these in another store locally and the price is much better than here. I hope Amazon will find a way to sell a case of 9 of these for $10. That would be a perfect subscribe and save item!"

They had a little sample table set up and I normally don't buy chocolate so I just walked by but I overheard the woman at the table say coconut curry and I ran over to see what they were talking about. I tasted the bar and my eyes rolled into my head. For me, this is the best mixture of tastes. I even told the woman at the table that this is by far the best chocolate bar I've ever had. The coconut is not a prominent flavor it is so mild that I don't taste it much if at all. The grittiness that someone mentioned, I believe, is the coconut so it adds more texture than taste in my opinion. This is not a mild bar with just a hint of flavor so if you are not a curry fan, this most likely isn't for you."

I like the fact that even though it is a powder mix, it is all-natural. I travel to the beach quite a bit and have found that is easy to cart in a cooler (no glass) and just pour over ice.  It is also good blended with strawberries or mango puree.  When I make mine, I follow the instructions including using Triple Sec but I usually mix 2 or 3 tequilas (white and gold)and add a little Gran Marnier or Cuantro.  It is great to have it mixed up, ready to go in the refrigerator.  You can also freeze it in the bag and 'squeeze' out for a fast slushy drink."
B00020HHM2,A17AQQD8K5WB63,sss147,5,6,5,2011-10-13,delicious,"This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it ""worked"" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus."
B000XIZLUS,AONCQPRX7Y1ZY,Ron,0,0,5,2012-04-10,Jelly Belly on the CHEAP!,"As many reviewers have noted each bag is really something of a mixed bag - literally!  So sometimes you'll get a few different beans that taste a little weird (we can thank the Bertie Botz that get mixed in).  But for the most part, you get a great variety of beans which to me taste great.  I haven't had any bags that were entirely one thing or another, although one of my bags did have a few more chocolate beans than usual, but again nothing too weird, so I may have lucked out, but from my experience, you get a good variety regardless.  Now I tend to be someone who likes to get a handful and occasionally enjoy one at a time, so if you are the one at a time person, you may have some problems with this bag.  On the other hand, I'm not a very picky person and I really have no complaints. For the price you get an excellent value on beans that would normally cost a lot more.  Overall, I'm glad I get these, and I know whenever they have sales on these I try to pick them up, because they can be difficult to get.  So if you're a fan of Jelly Belly, you've come to the right place, but if you're a little bit particular on beans, I'd suggest you shy away, or just know you may get some flavors that are not going to make you happy."

It is easy and quick  and effective to use, and we all like that we can control the level of ""fizz.""  I like more, the kids like less. I bought extra bottles and flavorings (for the kids) so everyone could do their own. We use it mostly with filtered water, although the tap water works perfectly well too, as long as you have good tap water.<br /><br />The flavorings will be used  not as much around here, although they seem good and the kids like them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product.

Tock came to our suburban DC home like a 60lb ball of energy and always wanted to run, run, run.  When at home he either slept or chewed our furniture.  We sprayed our furniture with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EI1BRO"">NaturVet Bitter Yuck No Chew Spray</a> to make it taste bad and redirected his chewing tendencies towards this toy.  As you can see, he loves the toy and although he is NOT a food-motivated dog, it combined with the Bitter Yuck to stop him from destroying property.<br /><br />As per other reviews, the treat is indeed difficult for my hands to stuff into the toy (my fiance did it in the end). Tock has been trying to get the treat out for about a week and not yet succeeded.  The way he manipulates the toy simulates how he would gnaw marrow out of a bone, engaging his paws as well as his jaws.  As an additional benefit, he is also less obsessed with running now, as you can see from the video.  The product does not smell or become sticky.  It is an outstanding product."

These aren't diet bars, or high protein bars, just good tasting snack bars.  My 15 year old athletic daughter also enjoys them and I know they would be great for an after school snack  before she has a team practice.<br /><br />The only minor negative about them is that they are a little sticky feeling, like the honey is still on them.

You will occasionally find dogs that can't tolerate certain foods and this is no exception. So far hasn't been a problem for my dog after > 2 years of this particular type. Breed: Giant Schnoodle, ~66 lbs. He loves fish so this is perfect. If we're having fish for dinner (tuna, baked tilapia, etc), you can be assured he'll be nearby with his nose turned up somewhere sniffing around."

I am very particular about what I give my dogs: dog of 10yrs died/cancer and had 2 knee replacements due to arthritis/joint issues. My Dogs are doing great on Canidae. I just spoke w/ Canidae less than 2 mins ago and they HAVE NOT changed their product at all. I read the review from the person that once gave this product a great review and now thinks the product has changed due to her dogs' digestive issues (or something like that).  I left a msg for Canidae about 20 mins ago, and they already called me back at work to answer my questions (unlike Blue during the food scare).  If you have seen a blog concerning something about Acetaminophen being in Canidae, that is false. Some lady said she had Canidae and some other foods tested by putting them in a baggie together...blah blah, any way it was a false allegation but the internet spreads rumors like wildfire.

B00006L2ZT,A2Y8DAMQ4PHSK9,AWKword,2,6,5,2002-11-08,Never A Dull Moment,"Finally, a collection of the best Camper Van Beethoven albums (I think there is one album missing from the band, a  major label release with intentionally clean over-production).  I had been waiting years for this dream CD, as I only possessed each one in vinyl.  <p>Some people like to listen to a full album that has a recognizable identity in its sonic experience.  You will not get that from Camper, as they instead offer a faint, mysterious familiarity in musical pieces that can tweak your ears in two opposing directions, even during the simplist compositions.  If that sounds appealling, you can correctly guess that boredom cannot maintain a presence with this compilation.<p>Categorizing this music is impossible, again due to so many style changes.  Psycho-country?  Unpretentious garage-rock with arena-sized talent?  Low-fi Hillbilly Jazz?  Spraycan Art-rock?  Gritty Underground Surf? Poor rich kids with Mischievous Aspirations transferring their energy into music? Kerouac whack?  How about calling it a ""Flexible Soup"".  It's anything but smooth, yet occassionally you find David Lowery's penchant for small club-guitar rock sneaking through (after CVB dismantled, he became the leader of the successful pop-rock group, Cracker).  It may be easier to instead think of the band as a group of hyper-static fellows whose medications are almost, but not quite at the right dosage.  They're simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I've held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band's intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask ""Why?"", yet with an immediate second thought you'll smile and say ""Why hasn't Anyone Else?""<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I've caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.  You will walk away wide-eyed at the unrealized potential and wasted energy we swallow in 99% of today's music. ]"

We use Xagave as our everyday sweetener, as well as a replacement for sugar products in baking and other deserts. While we do still use organic Maple syrup in moderation, Xagave has a bit lower glycemic load. So, I sometimes set aside a 25 oz (18 fl oz) bottle and add a tablespoon or so of Mapleine extract (you can usually find it here on Amazon or at most Wal-Mart superstores). After allowing a day or so for the extract to blend well with the Xagave, it works very well as a Maple syrup stand-in!<br /><br />I'm particularly pleased the last 2-pack of Xagave bottles arrived with new flip-top lids.

A friend of mine and I split several orders (e.g. bay leaves as well cinnamon), because the quantity was so generous that it made it even a better deal when we shared one order between two of us.<br /><br />I love Cinnamon in just about everything. I add it to many of chicken and meat recipes (give them Moroccan flavor influence), I add it my brewing coffee, add it to apple pies, quick breads and cookies.<br /><br />I love the taste of it, but Cinnamon is pretty amazing in other aspects as well. Several studies shown that 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon per day can help lower LDL cholesterol. It is also known that cinnamon has regulatory effect on blood sugar, making it beneficial to people with typ2 diabetes. Cinnamon has shown ability to stop medication-resistant yeast infections. A study at Copenhagen University showed significant improvement in arthritis pain in patients who took 1/2 cinnamon powder and honey daily for a month. It is also a natural food preservative, and inhibits bacteria growth in food.<br /><br />Note that there is a difference between ""Ceylon cinnamon"" and herb ""Cassia"" which looks and tastes like cinnamon. Cassia contains higher amounts of coumarin and coumarin is responsible for some side effects listed below:<br /><br />1) Skin Irritation: the essential oil of cinnamon applied directly to the skin causes irritation. Small amounts of diluted oil are beneficial, but full strength oil is an irritant.<br />2) Stomach Irritation: people with stomach ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome can cause stomach lining irritation. They should use it in small amounts only and diluted with other ingredients.<br />3) Increased heat rate: Large amounts of cinnamon increase heart rate in some people with heart conditions.<br />4) Blood thinning: Some studies shown that cinnamon has anti-clotting properties, and people taking other blood thinners should be careful. Large doses of cinnamon should be avoided after surgery or during heavy menstruation.<br />5) Kidney and Liver problems: Large amounts of coumarin can be toxic to kidney and liver.<br />6) Blood Sugar: People taking medication to control blood sugar should be careful with taking cinnamon as cinnamon has effect on blood sugar. Consult with your doctor if taking both.<br />7) Antibiotics: Cinnamon has antibiotic effect. If you taking both prescription antibiotics and cinnamon in large doses, consult your doctor about possible interactions.<br /><br />Frontier Cinnamon is fragrant and good value. I recommend it.<br /><br />Ali Julia review"

B0002YW26E,A392H7BKRZRUT3,R. Gordon,4,4,5,2010-09-18,A very effective product,"We tried using these Insect Magnets a year ago with great results. They are basically a next generation of the old ""Roach Motels""- a glue trap with an insect attractant inside. We initially tried them to combat scorpions since most poisons are only moderately effective on them due to their bodyweight. The product worked like a charm.<br />Two unintended benefits we noticed were that:<br />(1) Since they trap almost all bugs, they give you an idea of what type of bugs- and how many- are in the area that you use the trap in. In our case, we were surprised that almost no bugs were trapped in the kitchen, but many were trapped in the laundry room(where we later upgraded the weather stripping).<br />(2) The attractant really works well. After spotting a scorpion near a dresser(eek!) we placed a trap next to the sighting. About an hour later, it was safely stuck in the trap.<br />The only cons we found were that the traps are a little oddly joined into pairs, the attractant only seems to last for 2-3 months, and after the plastic packaging is removed any unused traps begin to attract bugs to them.<br />Overall a very good product, especially without the use of pesticides."

It is a sweet kids cereal, naturally in little saucer shapes. The back story was that the character Quisp had traveled for 15 years from his home planet to deliver Quisp to earthlings. For some reason Quaker employed an unusual advertising campaign that pitted two of their own brands against each other, Quisp versus Quake. The jaunty cartoon ads were created by Jay Ward and the Rocky and Bullwinkle team. As a kid I just loved the ads. Quaker has brought back Quisp for a limited time, and is selling it online as well as onsite in 6 cities in the USA. The offer gets you 3 regular size ceral boxes, and I found it tastes just like it did when I was a kid."

Six different bowls of dry food surround these felines on a daily basis. Thus, the cats are never close to being near the realm of famine.<br /><br />Then, I realize that Creampuff the Nasty is urinating more and generally being lazy. Elfie the Toothless vomits all the dry food after she eats, not unusual given her lack of teeth. Thus, I resolved to free my kitties of the tyranny of commercial, supermarket, dry food. It was an experiment that would have scared Dr. Frankenstein. Would my beloved brethren of puttygatos take their revenge in ways I had not yet considered after I took away their much loved food?<br /><br />Bowl by bowl, I stealthily switched to expensive, specially formulated cat kibbles. You name it. Every brand ever created. I was proud, I was broke.<br /><br />Alas, the Spoiled Ones disdained the new food ever so loudly. Nay Nay, they meowed, we shall not eat this expensive food! We are above it all, we are Felines.<br /><br />Then, EVO Dry Cat Food appeared in my vision. It was like stumbling out of Death valley and looking at the Pacific for the first time. I tried the standard version. The cats went wild. They sang and purred with joy, they slept next to the food. IT'S ALIVE!!!!<br /><br />Then, EVO's Herring Dry Cat Food was released. Yes, Yes, now there would be TWO versions. The cats sang and purred with joy again.<br /><br />Now Creampuff the Nasty is Creampuff the Contented and Elfie the Toothless is...well, still toothless, but she has gained 6 much needed pounds and her day now revolves around the dry food rather than her canned food.<br /><br />So, EVO is the greatest dried cat food ever created. Period. Check the ingredients, these cats eat better than we do."

B001DR0LU8,A11V54EXK14GKB,&#34;Sam&#34;,3,3,5,2011-07-04,Value!,"This is a huge bag of xylitol.  We were buying the small bags of birch xylitol, but went looking for something else due to cost. We are a family of three and all of us love yummy, sweet, creamy tea. I was not loving the sugar, though! My husband is diabetic and I was worried about my son having all that sugar. Sometimes I still use honey with my son, but my husband has completely switched to xylitol. After extensive research I think that I am okay using non-GMO corn xylitol. Honestly, I can't tell a flavor difference and the price comparison is huge.<br /><br />Pros:  Very good value for your money!  Great for families or people who do a lot of cooking. Bakes like sugar in the recipes we have done. It isn't quite as sweet as sugar and since we've been used to using it almost exclusively our taste buds have gotten used to it. Now, when I go out and I am offered a treat, or get one at a restaurant, I can't take the sweetness. I've gotten so I never eat dessert or snack on sweet things. I just don't like them anymore. I'm healthier and my husband is healthier. My son, who is seven, also never snacks on sweet things or even asks for them (with the exception of ice cream, sometimes). I think this is because he is used to not having them around. If he wants a snack he usually asks for things like crackers and goat cheese or fruit. I only mention this about my son because I have noticed that his peers are always snacking on really sugary things, things that now make my taste buds shudder.<br /><br />Cons:  The large size is a bit unwieldy and the zip-lock type closure doesn't work very well, at least on ours. Since I am a stickler for not having our food open to the elements we have had to invest in a large container for food storage. The large, good quality, food storage containers are expensive, but it a one time cost. We also have a smaller container for general family use that we re-fill from the larger one.<br /><br />Overall:  I will definitely buy this again!"

I'll be so bold as to say that it's as good as ""being there"" in a Caribou Coffee shop.  If you're a fan of a more Starbucks-y dark roast, this may not appeal to you.  While the Caribou Coffee's K-Cup flavor is not nearly as wimpy as Green Mountain or Donut House, it lacks that nearly burnt flavor that often pervades Starbucks' darker roasts.  If I had to guess, I would say that the primary bean in this blend is Kenya.  If you like Kenyan coffee, this is going to be a winner for you."

I have to keep my soy intake down because I have Lupus but these do not bother me. They are quite salty and on the rare occasion when I made a pig of myself and ate the whole bag it made my tongue sore. They are really good though. I bought mine at Trader Joe's but am delighted to find them now at Amazon (for only 11 cents more a bag) as it is a pain to go shopping and have to get my wheelchair in and out of the car.

Fowler ""Dragonfly77""",0,0,5,2012-09-19,"Both my cat and I LOVE Natural Balance ... she is happy, helathy and this food helps minimize the hairball activity!","Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals. I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food. Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis. A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing. I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results. I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food. I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity. I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it. This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />* Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />* Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />* Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />* Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />* Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />* High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco or head to the Natural Balance website. Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals. You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat. I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic. I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!<br /><br />Note:  This is essentially the same review I wrote about Natural Balance a couple of years ago, but my cat still loves it and I'm still buying it ... on Amazon."

I did not like using it with things like eggs, as there is the slightest residual coconut taste.

We have tried a few of the other fruits but they have been tougher for him to chew (especially the bananas!).<br /><br />If you buy them in a large package and don't find yourself eating them as quickly as we do, you may want to separate them into a few batches as they do get just a little soft after being open for a while (this doesn't affect the taste).<br /><br />A note--be sure to save the powder at the bottom of the container!  It is a delicious thing to sprinkle over cereal or yogurt!"

I was happy ( lucky!) to find it with the mill. The mill makes it easier to season with this product and spreads the maple flavor more evenly than the flakes alone.

The cocoa chocolate-ness is good but doesn't smack you over the head (meaning it's not a candy bar), and the tiny hint of spice offers just the right little zing to make these satisfying. The ORAC (antioxidant activity) in this item, in total, is sky-high -- much higher than blueberries, etc. -- so I'm delighted to eat them and give them to my family. The order from Amazon arrived as three of these yellow bags in one plastic shrink-wrap-like bag. They are much less expensive on Amazon than in a specialty health store, where I have seen them for $11 a bag. Organic, raw, vegan, gluten-, wheat-, dairy-, corn-, rice-, and soy-free, a charitable company, AND biodegradable yet plastic-like packaging?

The salt & pepper combination is unique and very tasty without being overpowering.

B000G6O2QG,A3RMGIKUWGPZOK,Jean Visnefski,2,2,5,2009-09-05,Great Chip!,"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period."

When I opened the bag there was really nothing remarkable about the smell other than sort of an earthy aroma mixed in with the matcha aroma. I shrugged and was like ""okay"" lol I just didn't know what to think. I have never heard of Lucuma let alone had Lucuma before so what do I know!?!<br /><br />I did however want to expand my horizons and the health benefits of Lucuma really interested me as well. Especially helping with skin inflammations and as an immune system booster!<br /><br />So I prepared the matcha of course and took a sip. It just tasted like matcha but of course a Red Leaf Tea quality matcha which equals GOOD STUFF!<br /><br />I added my ice and milk - as in my typical latte preparation of course, but this time did not yet add the splash of vanilla creamer. Took a sip - still the same - wonderful matcha flavor, but nothing else.<br /><br />So then I added my splash of vanilla low fat creamer, hummm now this is an interesting turn of events. I taste a light fruitiness here! Is it my imagination perhaps? Is it wishful thinking? Is it that somehow magically the creamer brought out the fruity flavor? Maybe it is a mental thing since this is now the way I usually enjoy my matcha - I have myself fooled into thinking things always taste better this way? I don't know. I am willing to admit if that is the case but maybe had I just added some sugar (there is sugar in the creamer I am sure - its not sugar free and even if it were it would have some kind of sweetener in it in the place of sugar right?). So I am thinking ... this must be a fruit that is complimented and made more predominant with the addition of some kind of sugar, not the creamer at all!<br />&#8232;So next time I have this I will leave the creamer out and add some sugar which ironically I had considered doing before adding my creamer but I just didn't want THAT much sugar in my matcha. Still for the sake of science next time I will!<br /><br />So then, how does this matcha TASTE? Well, its matcha tasting, with this light juicy like flavor similar to a melon. The fruit looks like an avocado to me. I looked up the Lucuma Fruit and found that it is supposed to have a flavor similar to a sweet potato and maple and you know what I do get that! Its light mind you the matcha flavor itself is the predominant flavor here. It is richer as a matcha though and I think that is due to the Lucuma! Still I get this melon flavor too. It truly is interesting and nothing about it tastes bad at all. I just don't really have my mind wrapped around it yet HOWEVER if you are adventurous and want to try something out of the box this is a good one to select for sure!"

To tell you the truth, I didn't find that thought unappealing, so I ordered it.<br /><br />My verdict?  It's a delicious coffee, and though stronger than a lot of coffees, I found it very drinkable and am entirely happy with it.  It's strong, but not at all offensive.  I think it has a pleasant taste, no strong aftertaste, and though I will admit it probably has a bit more kick than, say, my wife's Donut Shop coffee, I'm not buzzed on it.<br /><br />Incidentally, I think the only way to get K-cup coffee is to order it on subscription in order to get the 15 % markdown.  Be aware that even subscription prices are available to rise (and fall, I suppose) with the market.  I had thought the price was locked in, but I was wrong.<br /><br />I love K-cups, and I also love Amazon, but unless the prices drop soon, I'm going to have to buy them at Bed, Bath and Beyond...they're not too expensive over there, and they're always having 20 % off or $5 off coupons, as well as sales, and that is about the only way to get K-cups cheap.

He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight ""burnt"" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips."

However, ground Starbucks decaf is so expensive on Amazon that we started to look for an alternative. Tried Ecojava, Seattle's Best and Douwe Egberts. Seattle's Best was terrific but also quite pricey and not always available. Jeremiah's Pick is a family pleaser and with the subscribe and save program, I get 3 bags for the price of 1.8 - 2 bags of Starbucks. No sacrifice on flavor either! Gentle enough on stomachs to where I haven't seen any issues. :-)"

The one at home is a replacement for an older unit that died. It is convenient, fast and make the right amount (1 cup/mug). However, I am not such a big fan of a lot of the coffee that is available. Most of it seems bland, tasteless, and often a bit pricey, at least to me. However, while not a fan, in general, of Green Mountain coffees I found this flavor, Southern Pecan, to among the best that I have tried (Van Houtte & Timothy's primarily). The aroma is good, as is the taste. I always drink my coffee black, so I realize that I am probably missing out on some of the flavor by not doctoring it up with cream and sugar. Nevertheless, this flavor has become a stable of mine and I expect to continue purchasing it as needed."

The taste was making me want to throw up.  Instead of giving up on it, each time I would take a spoonfull, I would pull my tongue in and hold my breath, so that I couldn't smell or taste it.  Well, after one week I decided to check amazon and I found out that Nutivia had the best reviews and I went ahead and ordered it (ordered it from Nutivia website as it was a little cheaper).

Of those three, I felt the flavor was the best with Bigelow.<br /><br />I've been avidly drinking tea for the past 2 years (around 5 cups a day), and for the price I found this to be the best choice for flavor.<br /><br />It wasn't my final choice for tea to drink on a day to day basis though, as I find the packaging a bit of an inconvenience and Lipton is slightly cheaper (sometimes, prices vary quite a bit). I did like that the tea bags were air-sealed, and felt that helped bring out the flavor more, but found it troublesome to deal with the packets over time. This is a very minor inconvenience but it adds up a bit when you're drinking so much tea a day, and flavor isn't the biggest factor for me.<br /><br />Again though, probably the best tasting value tea I've had. Mileage will vary of course. Still give it 5 stars."

Like wine, a&ntilde;ejo tequila is aged to give it characteristics you'll want to enjoy. The slight bowl of the Riedel Ouverture helps direct the sweet vanilla and cinnamon notes to your nose, and is perfect for sipping to fully appreciate the unique qualities of the particular, and likely limited, batch of a&ntilde;ejo in which you've invested. Yes, they are fragile. They're made of glass. Treat them with care. I've run mine through my dishwasher several times with no problems, but I'm always cautious not to crowd them and to remove them slowly. These glasses were a tiny investment compared to what a bottle of high quality tequila costs, and I strongly recommend them to anyone out to deepen their tequila experience."

I considered buying reusable sillicon cups, but I don't trust kids to remember to bring them back! So I found these. They are unbleached and amazon.com sells them in a set of 24, so you get 60 x 24 = 1,440 for the price! I'm so relieved because I can bake without worrying that I'll run out of baking cups! Also note that they are as thin or possibly thinner than the cups you get at the store. This means that if you have a very fatty cake or muffin, grease will show up on the sides.

The other Glutino flavors aren't bad either but the chocolate is the best -- I find chocolate tends to help mask the glutin free flour taste in most cookies.<br /><br />I would recommend some caution in shipping them during the summer as you are more likely to recieve a cookie block rather than individual wafers (although the cookie block was pretty tasty too).

At the suggestion of my mother in law, we began using this product (1/2 tspn per day), and 10 days later, he began going poo on the potty with no problem at all, even asking to go, and went at school.  Prior to this, he would hold it because he was in so much pain when he went, and he never went away from the house!  We literaly BATTLED over going poo in the potty!  So this was the first miracle.  But then, within two days of that, he was back to my sweet, normal 3 year old boy and not so hyper and irritable.  He is smiling more, hugging us again, obeying simple rules and commands, and I feel like I have my son back!  I attribute all of this to the magnesium as we have not done anything different with his vitamins and diet than we had been doing for the last year.  He is also eating better, which I believe is because his tummy doesn't hurt as much now that he is regular.<br /><br />I do think I am going to cut back to 1/4 tspn/day though because the stools are a little looser, and he is taking 3 hour naps, so a little too sleepy.

I immediately zipped up my pants and ran to the store. I can't even begin to explain how relieved I am to be rash-free!<br /><br />I've heard this product works well on babies too. 5 stars!"

B0033HTCEW,A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,Angela Evans,0,0,5,2011-08-14,perfect with pastas or as a snack!,"These are the best sun dried tomatoes that I have found for several reasons.  These reasons include:<br /><br />1) Not packed in oil:  The first reason I love this product is that the tomatoes are not sun-dried and then packed in oil.  Many sun dried tomatoes come in large jars and have some type of liquid substance preserving them/adding flavor.  These do not.  They are dried and packed tightly into these little plastic containers.  The absence of oil makes these healthier and cleaner to work with.  Even though these lack a liquid component, there is still a softness to them.  They are not rock hard like some of the bags of sun-dried tomatoes out there.<br /><br />2) Little waste: The second reason I love this product is the size of the containers.  At 3.5 ounces, you have a manageable amount to use.  You don't need to worry about waste.  When you have a massive jar, once opened, the tomatoes are only going to stay usable for so long.  It is easy to use a 3.5 ounce container with one or two recipes.<br /><br />3) The taste:  I love the taste of these tomatoes.  A nice salty flavor accompanies them, but the salt doesn't overtake the phenomenal tomato taste.<br /><br />4) Perfect with pastas:  I love to make pastas, especially pierogies.  Perogies happen to taste wonderful with wilted spinach and sun-dried tomatoes that have been sauteed in brown butter with salt, pepper and some broth.  You don't need to stop with pastas though.  Try these tomatoes on salads and with sandwiches.  Each container has a recipe printed on the back of the lid.<br /><br />5) Perfect alone: The user doesn't have to feel a need to be creative with these tomatoes because they are perfect on their own.  Counting calories?  Mix up your daily eating routine and include a pack of these sun-dried tomatoes.  They have 225 calories per container, have a good deal of fiber (16.8 grams per container) and potassium and vitamin C.  Disclosure:  These have a good deal of sodium (300 mg per serving and there are 7 servings per container).<br /><br />6) Portable: Take these on a car trip.  Because the containers are made out of plastic, they won't break.  You don't have to worry about your children breaking a glass container and injuring themselves.  Again, because these are not packed with oil, you don't have to worry about liquid substances being splashed all over your car either.<br /><br />7) Packaging recyclable:  These tomatoes are packed in #1 PET plastic, which is readily recyclable in most areas.<br /><br />8) They last:  Because these have a lot of salt and are well-packed, they remain fresh for a very, very long time.  I've purchased large sums of these tomatoes and have had them sit for months unused.  When I experience a sun-dried tomato craving, I don't worry about the freshness because they have such a long shelf life.<br /><br />In sum, I love these tomatoes.  I use probably two packs a week for recipes and casual snacking.  I love that they are packed without any type of liquid and the containers are sized just right for recipes and/or casual snacking.<br /><br />I purchase these 3.5 ounce containers for about two dollars from my local grocery.<br /><br />These tomatoes are a product of Turkey and should be refrigerated after opening."

We have just finished the annual ritual of trying each and every brownie mix on the market, and this one (the Betty Crocker without the syrup package) wins hands down!<br /><br />This Betty Crocker (with no syrup pack) is the best tasting by far, according to the taste testers in my house, and can be baked to that chewy gooey chocolate richness we love so much. You can also make them cake style by varying the amounts of ingredients added.<br /><br />But we like 'em oooey gooey super chewy with added pecans around here. And a pan of brownies once a week until spring (around Valentine's Day usually) is a family tradition. Next year I'll remember writing this review and I will look myself up before the first brownie mix is purchased. Actually Amazon makes it even easier than that, I've just signed up for the automatic delivery so now all we have to remember is if it comes in the mail from Amazon, it must be THE GOOD STUFF!!!"
B005QRPGQU,A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP,Kathy,0,0,5,2011-11-02,A treat I can feel good about,"My beagles really loved these. The bones are approx. 4 inches long and kind of shaped like a real chicken bone.  When I opened the bag, I could really smell them - not really a good smell, but I guess it's something dogs like. Once they started eating them, I could smell the mint. I can't really say they are long lasting. I timed my dogs eating them and it took one 3 minutes and the other one 4 minutes.<br /><br />What I like is that these seem to be pretty good for our dogs. There are apples, carrots, chia seeds and parsley, among other natural ingredients in the bones.  There is no meat, just chicken flavor.  The price is definitely not out of line with other treats that are similar to this, such as Greenies and Healthy Edibles.  I'll probably continue to buy these."
B004SKVWNW,AXMM4F2OVZVBK,Sparky127,2,2,5,2011-11-16,Gerber *Best* Start,"We've used this since we brought baby home from the hospital 8 months ago (recommended by lactation consultant) and never had any issues with spit-up, gassiness, etc.  Formula in general doesn't smell that great, but this smells less formula-y than others and seems (anecdotally, at least, from other parents) to be tolerated pretty well.  Amazon's pricing is spotty, though.  When normally priced ($21.50), it's fully competitive with your local big box store or drugstore.com, but supply seems to fluctuate a lot, so it's either super-expensive or not available to ship for 4 to 6 weeks.  Minor detail, but I like that the packaging is an all-plastic container that you can recycle when empty (as opposed to the cardboard/tin containers).<br /><br />If you have a food scale already, I'd recommend using it to measure out the formula.  The directions say one scoop (8.9g) per 2 oz, but I found that a full scoop frequently weighs more like 10g.  Not a big deal if you only make 2 oz, but when I make 6 or 8 oz bottles, I prefer having a more accurate measure.<br /><br />And btw, if you use formula frequently, this has been absolutely indispensable for us - it makes life so much easier!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ET94A"">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary</a>"

It tastes better than the colored candy melts they sell at the stores and it hardens better too. The candy melts are hard to melt and stay chunky and clumpy making it necessary to add shortening. The shortening makes it harder for the candy to quickly dry and harden. It's also difficult to use edible markers on the candy melts because of the shortening (makes it oily).<br />With this almond bark, it melts down to a silky smooth consistency and you can write perfectly with edible markers.

I have two labs so I split one between the two of them every day.  They LOVE them.  Ok, they love any treat, but seem really excited by these.  One lab already has good teeth, the other does not.  Plaque covered the surface of all of her back teeth.  While the plaque is not 100% gone, it is greatly improved, probably about 75% of it has been removed.  I'm hopeful that with continued use, it will get even better.  Also, this product does not give my dogs intestinal ""issues"" as other rawhide treats have done in the past.  Only downside is that these chews are not consistently the same size or thickness.  Great product, I am hopeful to spread out dental cleanings more as they are pricey and require the dog to be put under."

I gulp down a can of this sugarfree Red Bull every morning about an hour before I make my daily walk. It has made the walks much easier to complete and also increases the walking speed which in turn burns more calories with which I am glad to part. I happened to be over at Sam's club a while ago and they carry this product for 33 bucks and some change so I picked up a case while there. I live about 10 miles from Sam's so with gas prices ever climbing plus the state sales tax it would not be worth a trip just for the Red Bull. For only a couple bucks more Amazon will deliver a case right to my front door. Kinda pricey but the benefits to me are worth the cost.

The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

You just have to remember to be vigilant, ask a lot of questions and read all labels and ingredients lists. Realistically, who is going to actually MISS crappy fast food (most of which is loaded with gluten)?<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago after peppering my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant with questions about their gluten-free preparation methods, I decided to roll the dice and order a gluten-free pasta dish.<br /><br />Wow. It was so good, with the taste and consistency of regular semolina pasta, that I was extremely nervous that I had blown it. Needless to say, I was wrong and felt fine after enjoying the meal.<br /><br />After trying countless gluten-free pasta types and brands: rice, buckwheat, quinoa, corn, etc. etc... Le Veneziane is absolutely hands down THE best gluten-free pasta out there period.

I don't mind my kids having a processed treat once in a while, and when they do I like to make sure that the ingredients are acceptable.

Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often."

I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.

I got this for my joints, but I've found that it gives a lot of flavor to diet soda for a lot fewer calories (and more vitamins) than normal soda.  I also use it mixed with a little oil and vinegar for a great salad dressing.  It can also be mixed with a little balsamic vinegar for a delicious sauce for chicken or pork.  I can't tell you how many people have asked for my chicken recipe when I use it as an ingredient in a glaze while grilling.  And being a concentrate, it takes up a lot less space in comparison to buying several quarts worth of unconcentrated cherry juice.  This stuff is amazing!"

The 1.6 ounce bar makes a good sized snack for an adult, and is big enough for two young children to share.  The flavor is of sesame and sweetness that is similar to honey.  The bars are solid and do not crumble, but they do bend and can be snapped in two easily."

B000HDMWC4,A1XZHLNSV0SULK,R. Pecoraro,2,2,5,2010-08-04,Wonderful sardines,"Sardines...you either love them or hate them.  There is no middle ground.  To those who hate them, dismiss them out-of-hand, or have not discovered them, I say, ""Good...all the more for me.""  I've been eating them all my life and picked up the habit from my father who, out of earshot of my mother, would remind me that one day when I was old enough to be hungover I would understand the benefits of the sardine.<br /><br />Apocryphal stories aside, Season brisling sardines packed in olive oil and from the cold waters off Norway are a fine, delicate, healthy food which, contrary to popular belief, can be enjoyed in more ways than simply cracking open a tin and slathering them on saltines.  They are increasingly difficult to find in retail groceries, so Amazon is the place to go.  And the price is right."

She would lick and scratch at herself until she created sores, and was overall, pathetic looking. She also vomited daily. I tried numerous high quality foods to no avail. Then I found Spot's Stew sensitive. I chose the seafood medley since seafood is her taste preference. She loved the food; but more importantly, in days the vomiting stopped entirely. In a few weeks she grew coat. Now, four months later, she has absolutely NO vomiting (not even hairballs). Her coat is thick and lusterous, and she has gained a significant amount of weight. Because this food has such a high protein and fat content, I have to feed her less or she would gain too much weight. But Spot's Stew has changed this animal's life. I recently adopted a Lhasa Apso puppy whose coat is dry and itchy. I have switched her from Wellness (her breeder's choice) to Spot's Stew Salmon for puppies. She LOVES this food, and she has always been a picky eater. I am expecting the same coat changes that I found with my cat. I was a dog show fancier, breeder, and kennel owner for 15 years, and if I were still in that business, I would be using Spot's Stew for all my animals. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny of the investment. OUTSTANDING food."

B000121718,A23JXBO3D3ELAA,Miltiadis,2,2,5,2010-07-10,Unique tasting water,"After reading reviews and comparisons of mineral waters I decided to try this one.  I ordered Badoit in the 750ml glass bottle size from a local distributor in S. Florida.  Price was approx. $3 per 750ml bottle and the case had 12 bottles. It comes with a crown cap so you must have a cork handy to seal it back and preserve its natural carbonation, unless you plan to finish the bottle right away.  The TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) is approx. 1200 mg/lt so it ranks as a High Mineral water which is good.  Although there are other waters with 3000 or more, many times a big part of their TDS is sodium. The opposite end would be distilled water which leaches the human body from its store of minerals - very harmful.<br />Badoit has a good amount of Bicarbonate at 1300 mg/lt and it has a PH of 6 both of which are considered to aid digestion.<br />The main charactestics of this water are that it has i) natural carbonation, ii) the bubbles are indeed mild (compared to say Perrier where the first two gulps hit even your nostrils with gas) and iii) it has a unique almost herbal aftertaste, so, unlike other waters you could never mistake it for any other brand.<br />If price is not an issue go for it.  Another excellent choice is Gerolsteiner also comes in 750ml glass bottles with its own carbonation and a good taste. It has a little higher Bicarbonate and TDS than the Badoit but you might miss the Badoit's unique taste.<br />Avoid San Pellegrino and Perrier as they both have very low Bicarbonate and Perrier has very low TDS as well."

This is a poor excuse for a blind tasting, but the expert foodies with cast iron palates decided that several imitations were better than the original.<br /><br />Since I have trouble finding Red Oval, I decided to give the ubiquitous Wheatsworth, ranked number two behind Whole Foods, a try. Gag me. They are truly awful. I wouldn't serve them with aerosol Velveeta, let alone a pricey Humboldt Fog. They are chock full of superfluous ingredients, thus failing the Occam's Razor test AND they contain too much salt, sugar, and honey. They had no cracked wheat texture whatever and a mouthfeel more like Graham Crackers. If these were intended to imitate the Red Oval product, they did a darn poor job of it.  I think they are snack crackers and should not be compared to adult food. I guess the tasters liked sweet and salty.<br /><br />So, I did what I had to do.  I threw out the Wheatsworth and ordered a 12-pack of my 35 year favorite, Red Oval Farms Stoned Wheat Thins."

When he had gobbled it up, he sniffed all over to see if possibly there might have been a crumb dropped anywhere, and then came to me to see if perhaps I felt like giving him an extra helping.  And, not that it matters, but this food does look fancier than the normal dog food I feed him, with some of the kibbles resembling hunks of meat.  I was also impressed that the first ingredient was beef, although there was also lots of other stuff that was nowhere near natural.  I would also say that the softness of the beef-look kibbles is probably not great for his teeth, but maybe that's not a problem for you if you brush your dog's teeth.

However, keeping her weight down as she gets older was very important. We'd been using the normal Wellness Healthy Weight and she seemed to enjoy that. We changed her to the CORE after she started to get red skin on her belly. After switching, which had no effects on her GI, the redness went away. She also had has no tendency to want to eat this after it was digested (if you know what I mean!) which can be an issue with many weight management foods.<br /><br />I did my homework online and read a lot of online sites before switching. I can say hands down, Wellness CORE is a great food and if you can afford the small increase in price, I think you and your furry friend will enjoy its benefits.<br /><br />This smaller 4-pound bag is nice for taking to grandma and grandpa's for when she visits. We usually pick up the 12lb bag for our day to day feeding at home. I did notice more and more local stores starting to carry this, so I think the Wellness CORE is starting to pick up market share."

B001EQ5PVI,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,Themis-Athena,20,22,5,2006-07-07,"The ""green pearl"" of tea.","Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the ""green pearl"" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."

We did try the same flavor description from four other vendors in the past. We are repeat customers simply because the flavor is perfect, unlike anything else with a similar description made by other coffee vendors. This last time we ordered, we ran out and had to be satisfied with another brand, and there just were no happy mornings for the adults in this family those two mornings. This particular coffee is fully flavored, but has pretty overtones, with just the right amount of (hmmm) sweetness (?) to make it not need additional cream or sugar. The aroma is out of this world. It is not harsh like the coffee from that company with the green circular logo that has the drive-through window. That coffee could grow hair on your chest! This coffee does not irritate my stomach with acidity like other brands have done in the past. I do not get jittery either.<br /><br />Each package is sealed and labeled, and can be resealed, but I use a rubber sealed canister. The packages Red Buffalo ships make beautiful, thoughtful gifts. I buy the ground version, but I seem to remember that the whole bean was once ordered by us by mistake and the coffee was just as good either way.

An entire bag of pop chips is around 400 calories, as opposed to a serving size of normal chips.  My favorite is Sour Cream & Onion, but they all are pretty good.

Nice cheese flavor.,"I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great.

The scent is crisp and pleasant but with no undertones (fruit, floral, or citric) that I can identify. You mostly smell it while showering, because it doesn't linger on your skin later to compete with deodorants or other products.<br /><br />But, what made my rating go from a 4 to a 5 star is that I found it less slippery in the shower than previous products I had tried. (I recently almost slipped in the shower while using a Johnson and Johnson body wash that left my acrylic shower mat a little greasy.) Those of us who are in the age group in which we need moisturizing, are also in the age group in which we have to be very careful to avoid falling.

Does NOT taste like a protein shake!,"First of all, as with ALL protein shakes, you really should test out different amounts of water vs. powder to see what tastes best to you.  I have discovered that I typically like a more watery shake (less powder) than what the manufacturers recommend.  Some people can look at this as a negative, since you would need to drink 2x the liquid to get the same nutritional value for ""one serving,"" but if you're trying to loose weight, sipping throughout the day isn't a bad thing.  As far as this shake goes, using two full scoops taste like a strong version of International Foods Sugar Free Vanilla Latte Instant Coffee.  Anyway, here is what works for me:<br /><br />1.  16oz cold water & a few ice cubes<br />2.  one scoop of Click powder<br />3.  Combine in my 20oz Venti Starbucks reusable cold-cup.  Put lid on without straw, place finger over hole for straw, shake vigorously. Remove lid, replace straw, ENJOY!<br /><br />In my opinion, drinking this shake this way is REALLY delicious and taste just like iced coffee. It does NOT have the typical protein shake flavor and aftertaste at all.  I just wish they made a decaffeinated version so I could drink it all day long!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this shake hot, but I'm going to continue experimenting with that and update my review accordingly!"

He just got on his last piece and we are ordering more for him. He is our Pride and joy and giving him this treat, that is good<br />for him is a pleasure for us. If you love your 4 legged babies as much as we do, go ahead and treat them. You will smile at the pleasure they get while enjoying this healthy treat!<br />Awsome! Wish they offered in larger qty packages. Even though they last along time, never want to run out of our litte Sir Dash Alot's favorite treat!<br />Thanks for such an awsome product!<br />Clytie & Sir Dash Alot in NC"

I've found green teas can be easily ""burned"" if you boil your water before steeping, so be sure to stop heating your water before the boiling point (I just use a Chantal ceramic teapot & heat a cup of water in it in the microwave for just 2 minutes, then steep in a cup--perfect.  I like to sweeten it with a package of Sweet Leaf Stevia==healthy antioxidant heaven & no caffeine!).<br /><br />Also, don't steep any green tea too long--about 3 to 3-1/2 minutes is just right for green tea--otherwise, it WILL be bitter, regardless of brand.<br /><br />I love the fact that these tea bags are individually packaged in foil-lined packs; tea stays fresh and delicious until you're ready to enjoy a cup.

My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.

Basically I store the bottle flat end down so that the shampoo is always at the bottom (near the spout) and can be dispensed easily.  However, when you store it this way (which is the way the conditioner bottle was designed to be stored), the writing is upside down unlike the conditioner bottle which has the product label showing correctly.

Khannah-Brown""",13,16,5,2006-10-04,"Impressive Cup of Tea, Could Be Helpful with Women's Health Issues","*****<br /><br />This Woman's Dong Quai Tonic from Yogi Tea is for hormone balance. I'm pretty finicky with my tea tastes and I like it. It has an herby and slightly spicy, slightly sweet taste to it that makes it a pleasure to drink. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for overall health and fatigue relief. It is stronger that way, and more intense of an experience, although it still tastes great with just one bag. I'd been having lots of hot flashes and wanted to get down to business with this tea.<br /><br />Woman's Dong Quai Tonic comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and is organic.<br /><br />The ingredients in Woman's Dong Quai Tonic are: dong quai root extract, juniper berry extract, and a proprietary blend of herbs, including all organic: cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, fennel seed, chamomile flower, dandelion root, anise seed, stinging nettle leaf, dong quai root (I guess as opposed to the extract), black pepper, and orange oil. Amazingly, I can taste some of these, like the chamomile, and the anise seed and the ginger, making for a lovely and complex cup of tea. I'm impressed!<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Organic Woman's Dong Quai Tonic is an effective and organic way to lessen fatigue, restore your energy and balance a woman's hormones. This healing tonic is formulated to ease what traditional Chinese medicine practitioners refer to as ""blood deficiency,"" resulting from stress, poor digestion, or improper eating and health habits. We've included in our tonic the potent ""Queen of Herbs"" Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis), shown to be effective in supporting the reproductive organs, addressing common female hormone imbalances, helping to regulate the menstrual cycle and building all-around health. Bartram's Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine (1995) indicates Dong Quai is useful for a wide range of female conditions, including minor symptoms of PMS (such as mild mood changes) and menopause (such as hot flashes). This powerful herb is complemented by Organic Nettle to help detox your body, as well as Organic Dandelion Root and Juniper Berry to help maintain proper water balance. According to yogic wisdom, women have greater emotional awareness and intuitive powers. A woman can choose to be balanced, happy and healthy. Choose to drink a daily cup of Woman's Dong Quai Tonic and feel like your healthy, beautiful, graceful self."" I don't know about that, but I do like the tea, and it seems like it might be helping with my hot flashes (I've been having fewer...whether or not it's due to the tea, I don't know!), which is why I bought it---for menopausal support.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

I was hesitant to try it as it is quite hard to give my dog any ""medicine,"" and I figured if the vitamins were anything like human vitamins, it was going to taste nasty and it was a fight I did not want to battle.  To my surprise, when I opened the bottle, it smelled like peanut butter, which my dog LOVES.  Awesome start.  I gave it to Lightning and lo and behold, he loved it!!  And wanted more!  I was so happy that I had to hold myself back from giving him more than 1 a day.  He loves it more than some of the ""treats"" we give him when he's been good.  I love it because I'm never sure he's getting enough nutrition from the dog food and the supplements (alfalfa, spirulina, etc) sound like the stuff we would want for ourselves but wouldn't know how much to give to our pets.  Since this multivitamin is made by a vet AND a nutritionist and this brand was recommended by my vet (who is AMAZING), I feel completely at ease giving this to Lightning every day.

With it's list of simple, and wonderful organic ingredients, starting with whole grain spelt flour and millet  as the grains (instead of wheat flour), good balance of healthy (source) carbs, healthy (source) fats, non animal protein, and fiber, without a horrible amount of sodium (though at 220mg/oz it is higher than I would prefer), and a reasonable sale price, I had to give these a try.<br /><br />First off, they were shipped right away, and came snugly packed in a box, that was then put in to a larger Amazon box with some plastic air filled pillows to help keep them from getting banged up. The use-by date is 7/6/10, a full 3 months away.<br /><br />OK, let me just say - Wow! - These fantastic crackers are truly amazing! Substantial, dense and very crunchy. The flavor is incredible, I could happily live on them for a long time!<br /><br />I always say when it comes to cooking, the ingredients speak for themselves, and their quality was evident here. The only thing I was concerned about, was the possibility that the moisture from the seeds, might make the crackers lose their fresh crunchiness. I had previously tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDKRFK"">Ryvita Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Sunflower Seeds & Oats, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, which had that unfortunate problem (though they weren't stale, they just didn't seem at their peak). Though I did enjoy them, they pale in comparison (both literally & figuratively) to these Doctor Kracker Seedlander crackers. I like Ryvita's short list of simple ingredients, but they are much lighter in weight and texture, and they make slightly messy crumbs when you break them, although you might prefer the Ryvita if you have an objection to yeast (which is in these).<br /><br />I love how these ""Snackers"" come in pre-cut little 1.5"" bite-sized squares with no mess. It's also easy to count out 8 for a 1oz serving size. Despite being sweetened with agave syrup (which I like because it doesn't spike your blood sugar), they are not too sweet. It's just the right touch, and the small amount of molasses adds to their delicious flavor. They would also be good crumbled onto a salad or as a soup (like butternut squash soup) topping.<br /><br />Many thanks to Amazon for helping me to discover these heavenly treats!"

These diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program, or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time. I liked them, and my wife liked them, too."

Also great to keep around for those recipes that call for whole milk, when you don't want to buy a whole gallon. We've also used these to take with us on trips for cereal, coffee, drinks, etc. and it's great because you don't have to refrigerate the carton until you open it.

Although the risk for thiamine deficiency is remote, the company is taking the extra precaution of voluntarily removing these products from store shelves and asking customers to return any of the affected lots.

The first taste is a bit surprising, so it's better just to think of it as its own thing and not expect it to taste like all the other cocoas you've had.  I loved to use it in cakes (I had to increase the flour a little in mine or drop the sugar because it made the already moist cake just too gooey otherwise).  I use the Cooks Illustrated recipe (6 chocolate cakes, sour cream), and with the special dark, it's a family and neighborhood favorite. I also love that it turns icing nearly black.  I've gotten several commetns about how beautiful the cakes are made with this cocoa.<br /><br />Our favorite use though is in hot cocoa.  I use 2tbsp cocoa powder with 1-2 tbsp sugar and add 8 oz of boiling water.  We love it just to drink, it looks like the darkest cocoa ever, and is more like a coffee drink, grown up hot chocolate...  Our skeptical friends even love it, you should definitely give it a try!!  We used to make the cocoa twice as strong, but found 2tbsp is enough for us because it's a very strong cocoa.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  It's better for you... in one cup of the cocoa above (with 1bsp sugar) compared to a cup of cocoa with the same recipe and regular ""natural"" hershey's cocoa powder (note, it includes 2tbs of each and sugar, not the 1 tbsp on box)<br /><br />________________special dark_______________regular<br /><br />calories............95.......................95<br /><br />g fat................1........................1<br /><br />g fiber..............4........................2<br /><br />g protein............2........................2<br /><br />Iron................30%.......................8%<br /><br />with the twice as strong recipe, we were getting 60% of our iron from each cup, which is amazing to me.

To be perfectly honest, I had to look up how to SPELL connoisseur! But having a heart attack 6 months ago, I am learning to never use caffeine, salt, or almost ANY darn thing I love. And I HATE anything that is ""light"", decaf or artificially sweetened. My wife has bought about every single brand of instant decaf coffee for me along with assorted ""real"" decaf to try in her drip coffee maker. Hated em all, just hated them. Saw this so thought I would try the latest brand I would hate since it wouldn't cost me anything.<br /><br /> First batch was way to bitter for me, didn't even want to try any more but my wife said she would make it weaker. From that next batch on, I became hooked on this brand. I don't like the price, but love the taste.  That conflict alone makes me drop my rating to give it a 4 star overall. If I tinker with taste as I also add assorted coffee-mate creamers (also something I am not allowed anymore but REFUSE to give up), the taste goes to a 5 for me.

It is a wonderful thing to find at least one new thing (for ME anyway) that I can still really enjoy, that helps me relax in the middle of all this can't eat this, can't drink that ""stuff"" going on in my life the past 6 months.

And of course, mixing your own can be annoying as well.  I've been looking for a good recovery drink for about 3 years now as I train for half marathons and until now I didn't have much luck.  I spent most of my time mixing powdered drinks in my blender - and rewashing my blender everyday.  Everyone knows that protein drinks don't mix well and tend to clump, so using a blender is always the fastest way.<br /><br />With the reGen drink, at first I was skeptical.  I thought I would have to shake the drink immensely and then of course still have clumps, but I did not.  The drink is smooth and, to me, tastes like Double Fudge Yoo-Hoo.  It's a chocolate milk like taste, but slightly thicker and more chocolately.  And of course, the drink does not need to be intensely shaken.  In fact I forgot to shake one and really didn't notice much difference.  The consistency seems evenly flavored.<br /><br />The protein level in this drink is perfect for runners & bikers, but seem a little low for weight lifters.  It has 11 grams per container.  I personally drink one for a 3-5 mile run and if I run 6-8+ miles I might have two.<br /><br />One thing I like is that they travel easy.  Even though they are basically like milk, they are easier than milk for my needs.  I often throw one in my backpack and take it with me to the gym.  After running at the gym, I drink it on the way home.  I usually stop to get a cup of ice at a convenience store to drink it with.  I think they taste best ice cold, but they do not have to be refrigerated unless already opened.  This makes it easy for someone to put in travel pack while hiking, running, biking, etc - unlike milk these will not sour in mild temperatures, but I would not subject them to 80+ degree temp for very long.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this product.  If you are looking for something easy & tastes normal - this is it."

Thirsty or not, Hot or cold, this tea can help you in many ways. As a college student studying to be an entrepreneur, I can't just take prescribed drugs all the time to keep my attention span up. Instead, I turn to caffeine all day every day. Runa Tea has been one of the few products that have really caused me to feel refreshed as if I was just hydrated after a run, as well as feeling focused as if I were ready to write a 10 page paper from scratch. I don't know what it is, but it just makes you feel good in every way. Personally, I love the cold tea- but as a consumer everyone needs to find their niche, as I am a huge hot tea drinker and chose the cold version- Either way, same thing.  You need to try it. And then try and contradict our 5 star opinions! :)"

I just read another reviewer saying these don't taste like corn tortilla chips and I couldn't disagree more. These have a great fresh corn tortilla chip taste. Basically these taste like a great tortilla chip but without any greasy feeling or taste. As far as the flavors go that's going to be subjective. Nacho cheese Doritos had always been a favorite of mine before Popchips and I think the nacho cheese Popchips are a great alternative. Sorry Doritos, too much fat. Ranch is good also and I'd rank it 2nd out of the 4. As far as the limon and salsa they don't stand out as favorites but I have no complaints and they're nice to have for variety."

Consequently, I feel much more confident about storing it in my pantry long-term, because I know the contents will be utterly impervious both to pests and to weather. These bags are also quite convenient to take camping (yes, with a camp stove you can make brownies out in the wilderness! That's what silicone brownie pans are for, isn't it? ;) ) because, again, in its sturdy sealed plastic bag the mix is impervious to pests both large and small and even more severe weather than in my pantry, plus the plastic bag, while sturdy, is much lighter and easier to cram into odd corners of a backpack than a cardboard box is, and if it rains heavily or the canoe takes on water, there's no need to worry about the mix being ruined!"

All natural and stuff but why would you pay over a dollar for a pack of gum then pay to have it shipped to your house and wait a week to chew it.  You can go to the gas station on your way home from work or school and enjoy the gum right then.  Of course it is all natural for the health nuts which is good I guess.  But my way of thinking is would you rather have bug poo or bug poison on your food.  It's give and take.  Neither is good for you.  In short it's good gum.

How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat's reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br />""Meowwwww! Errowwww!"" (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I'll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.  The noted finickiness of cats usually applies to dry food.  Place a bowl of any random dead animal parts in front of them and they are far more decisive.

We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost."

B0038B39E2,A30LJ78OID5YNK,ARLENE PALERMO,7,7,5,2012-06-07,My Favorite--I LOVE this stuff,"I have multiple food allergies, which makes a grab-and-go breakfast...well...not possible. I wanted a meal replacement shake because I tend not to eat during the day (way too complicated) and not eating actually helps me gain weight. I also have some other health issues--like Hashimoto's--directly related to my allergies. Food is an issue for me, and so is energy and feeling well.<br /><br />I'm not vegan, but I prefer vegan foods for their cleanliness. I can't have soy, but many vegan products are soy-free anyway. I also like whole, organic, Non-GMO foods, and while I prefer Raw, I don't mind non-raw foods, either.<br /><br />I tried several vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free shake mixes: Garden of Life, Vega, Inca Meal, RAW, etc. This is, by far, the best tasting, best ""feeling"" shake I've tried.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors--Chocolate is my fave, then Pomegranate (sp?) Mango and Vanilla Chai, in that order. I mix mine is a shaker cup with a little mixing ball. I use Vanilla almond milk and a little agave syrup (I hate Stevia, it tastes like saccharine to me) and sometimes I throw a little extra hemp protein in, chia seeds, and flaxseed oil. I haven't bothered with a blender yet. One day, I'll put it into a blender with some fruit.<br /><br />Let's be real: this is a whole food shake with fruits, veggies, grasses, and hemp protein. This is not a mass-market, full-of-stuff-I-can't-pronounce homogenized drink. This is real food, synthesized down to a mixable level. Dunkin Donuts it's not. So?<br /><br />Truthfully, the pure, clean, feel-good energy I get from this, plus the cleansing, tonifying, and gut-health benefits are worth chugging down a slightly earthy drink every morning. Mixed with vanilla almond milk & a little agave, I actually savor the flavor--not too sweet (sweet in the morning makes me gag) chocolatey and, well, nutritious-y.<br /><br />Try a sample packet (you can get them at your local HFS, usually) and see which flavor suits you. I don't ever like this mixed in water--its just too thin. I DO use it on oatmeal, or stirred into yogurt. This is an awesome product. I just saved $12 over what I pay at WF, plus Amazon will deliver it to me every 15 days so I'll never run out...heaven!"

However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account."

I would like to review my automated ordering cycle so the canisters do not pile up. In addition, it would be nice to know what the suggested shelf life is for this product in their sealed container?

B000FA38ZY,A2DYMDOAJURO5F,"Aceto ""Hope is a Weed Exasperatus: 1:18""",3,5,5,2011-10-22,Not Moon Pie and not sorry about it.,"In 1913 it was Mexico that had its revolution.  The Romanovs  by contrast, celebrated 300 years of rule.  Woolworth opens the world's tallest skyscraper, casting a dagger-like shadow every morning aimed at the heart of West Hoboken.  The result, in life imitating Michelangelo's Creation, was the American incarnation of the Danish Chocolate Coated Marshmallow Cookie, The National Biscuit Company's Mallomar.  While New York's version cannot compare to the 800 million of the original produced annually in Denmark, the loyalty is as fierce as any Viking's.<br /><br />The appearance of  Mallomars mean one thing.  It is harvest time.  We cannot get these in France, where harvest centers on mere grapes.  But I remember the old Nabisco factory that used to make them.  Now they are imported from Canada.  Not French Canada, home of the vaunted Whippets, another older version with fiery loyalty.<br /><br />But a couple of the original ingredients are still used.  Sugar is not sweet enough for modern tastes.  Instead, high fructose corn syrup is used to supplement.  It has the added advantages of making use of the corn subsidy and doubling the body's fat producing efficiency.  Good thing, because these little wonders have only 45 calories out of each 120 coming directly from fat.<br /><br />And what fat is that?  Mostly saturated fat. What saturated fat?  Well, highly saturated fat - palm oil.  Actually, there are two.  The other is from the kernel of the oil palm.  It is even more highly saturated.  These oils are really cheap.  All you do is denude the natural palm groves.  And by grinding up the seeds along with everything else, you ensure that the palm groves cannot return.  Could be worse, it could be trans fat.  And the minority contribution does ensue from monounsaturated fat.  Which one you timidly ask?  Canadian Low Acid Oil, better known as canola.  So you can breathe a sigh of relief.  That is unless you happen to be one of those who do not like the idea of genetically modified organisms that allow corporations like Monsanto to control patents on the once natural ability of crops to reseed themselves.<br /><br />You know what a marshmallow tastes like.  But one encased in a hard chocolate shell is not exposed to air.  This changes the surface texture.  It is less chewy because there is no drying.  The shell is hard, but thin.  So this brittleness has a crunchiness to it, yet it is thin enough so that there is no resistance.  The chocolate is dark chocolate, as New Yorkers prefer.  It gives that lingering chocolate aftertaste.  The whole experience is mediated, extended by the cookie.<br /><br />These cult treats are immune from all the above attacks.  Such is the nature of a cult.  Impervious, intractable and intransigent.  How do you know it is a cult item?  Look at the box.  Nabisco does not plaster it all over with the standard marketing drivel.  It is not new and improved.  It is not DELICIOUS.  It is not given with recipes or serving suggestions.  It makes no apologies.<br /><br />I will make one suggestion.  If you do not want it with milk because milk is not sold out of quart bottles for you to chug, go to the other extreme.  They go with classic cream tea."

And then she texted me ;) anyways thank you for allowing me to get a girl tipsy from 1000 miles away!!!"

My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them ""puppy heroin"". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll"

I use a burr grinder and a very nice Starbucks drip coffee maker. In fact, I am enjoying a cup of the cofffe right now after dragging my lazy behind out of bed at 9am&lt;g>.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this roast. The beans arrived fresh and well packed with a valve on the heavy poly bag. The beans are of a uniform roast with a nice oily sheen throughout. There is no chaff mixed in with the beans. I do some home roasting of my own beans so I have an idea of what the process is and I can state confidently that these are well roasted, cleaned of chaff and that the roast is in fact a dark roast.<br /><br />The coffee tastes just as I like it, a full rich flavor without that acidic slightly burned flavor of a French roast. The taste is very smooth and rich, the main traits that attracted me to Starbucks coffee, craft roasters and eventually home roasting.<br /><br />I get free shipping from Amazon and I bought this on their subscription program, so it cost me $31 plus tax. I think this is a very good price and I would gladly make this roast my daily brew.<br /><br />I recommend this roast without reservation.<br /><br />-Mike"

The body is unrivalled.  Everything is balanced in a way that is unique to the Kona bean, but there are no subtle undertones prevalent that make me like the Sumatran and Ethiopian beans so much better.  The beans are aesthetically perfect in every way, and I only have to use about 2/3 the portion of what I would use to make my favorite brews, but this is where it gets touchy for me.  I pay about $12-13 a lb for coffee that might not be better than Kona coffee, but I like it better.  Hawaii Growers makes a mighty fine coffee, one of the best Konas I've ever tasted, but it isn't worth more than $25 a lb.  No coffee is worth that to me, and I've tasted the world's finest.<br /><br />Hawaii Growers is very competitively priced compared to other Konas, so if Kona coffee is the drinker's coffee of choice, then Hawaii Growers is a great choice.  For someone who prefers coffee from other regions, Kona still stacks up well, but a purchase for me was to simply try something new rather than to look for a new regular."

B000GW257S,A28G5L09ORIUPT,Anastasia,24,28,5,2006-11-13,Finally a flavored sugar!,"First of all, If you read nothing else, I have to say........BUY IT!<br /><br />Okay, that being said, here's more:<br /><br />For years I kept seeing flavored creams everywhere.  Why don't they make flavored sugars, I wondered.  Interesting that Splenda came out with flavored sugars, as it was about one year ago that I emailed the company with the idea.  Perhaps it is just a coincidence.  Anyway, it doesn't matter...it is really (really) good.<br /><br />I've tried them all.  Vanilla being my favorite.  Mocha a very, very close second, and hazelnut is a distant (but worth trying) third.<br /><br />All of the flavors are very (well...) flavorful.  So much so, that in a ""travel mug"" size coffee cup, I use one flavored packet of Splenda and one regular Splenda and it's plenty flavorful.<br /><br />The vanilla is very vanilla-y (which I happen to prefer to chocolate).<br /><br />The mocha is very chocolately and delicious, especially for me, not being a chocolate fan.<br /><br />The hazelnut I could take or leave and I would take it if the others weren't around.  It is not at all or in the least bit objectionable, however.<br /><br />My only objection to this Splenda is the packets themselves (those tall, skinny packets) are somewhat cumbersome to open the way they were intended to be opened, I think.<br /><br />You are supposed to fold over the top just slightly and then use the already slit part at the top to tear it apart.<br /><br />The problem lies in that when you tear it this way, it tears all the way down the packet and can spill out.  ...and if you stop tearing it at mid-package, you end up with a small ""pocket"" of torn package that you have to hold with one hand while dumping the contents out with the other.  Otherwise, the small torn part of the package gets filled with the sugar and you have to dump that out, too.<br /><br />So, I use my teeth to tear it across the top (the way you open a freeze pop) and that way avoid the whole ""ordeal"".<br /><br />It's REALLY not that big a deal, I'm just sayin', that's what happens.  (this is a review, afterall).<br /><br />Other considerations:<br /><br />I read that you can find the product at certain Walmart stores (just not one near me), which means that Sam's will have it soon (in bulk).<br /><br />It is a little expensive, about one dollar more per box than regular, but so is Starbucks, and frankly, it's worth it, and I hate Starbucks bitter (tastes like it's several hours old) coffee, anyway.<br /><br />I've also tried the vanilla Splenda in my Grape Nuts cereal, and didn't care for it as much as I thought I would.  I prefer plain Splenda for that, but you might really like it, and it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />I haven't tried it in hot chocolate, but I will and it will undoubtedly be good.<br /><br />The flavor is so concentrated that you could probably serve it in a cup of hot water, which I also haven't tried and am actually kidding about.<br /><br />You can tell how strong it is when you are opening it up with your teeth and you taste it.  You can also smell it in your coffee from across your desk. It's wonderful.<br /><br />I purchased one of each of these flavors on Amazon. (no doubt, it's a lot of Splenda, but there are no shipping fees, so it's a great deal).<br /><br />I am now the star of the office since it is not really out yet in the stores (around here) and everyone here loves it.<br /><br />The other thing I'd like to mention about Splenda (in general) is that it is the only ""sugar substitute"" made from real sugar.  The best thing about this is that it doesn't react in your body like real sugar does, but it tastes the closest to real sugar, in my opinion, than anything else.<br /><br />Most importantly, it does not cause an insulin response in your body, which is what happens when you eat real or (chemical) artificial sugar substitutes.<br /><br />This is a HUGE plus for your body since sugar is the BIGGEST EVIL in our weight gain problems in this country.  Sugar is many, many, many times more the culprit in weight gain than any fat could be, as far as making you fat goes, because sugar CONVERTS TO / BECOMES FAT upon our digestion of it.  So to have Splenda come out with a flavored sugar is just the greatest thing.  It's even better than sliced bread because I like my slices really thick and sliced bread usually isn't.<br /><br />Well, that's all folks...hope you enjoyed.<br /><br />Now, sit back and watch, all of the other sugar makers will be coming out with flavored sugars, soon, and then it will be everywhere.  Choose Splenda for your health!  Oh, and by the way, I do not work for Splenda, if that's what you were thinking, I just love it that much.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Anastasia"
B000EH0RU2,A38XW5668UKIJ6,Truth Crusader,7,7,5,2007-01-14,TASTES GREAT but overpriced,"On one of my ""we've got to start eating more healthy"" days, I saw this product.  I, personally like brown rice, etc., but I have a family that for the most part thinks anything healthy doesn't taste good.  I ordered it and served it and everyone liked it.  Even my most staunch ""I hate healthy food"" critic, my teenaged son admitted he liked it.  My only complaint would be the price which I think is too high and when you add shipping it becomes a luxury item. Healthy, complete grains that haven't been processed should be cheaper than their processed counterparts, or at least closer in price.  It's so much cheaper to eat unhealthy.  Still if you want something good for you and tastes good, try this."

Neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely. I decided to try this as it's made by a respected international brand & I thought a systemic product might work.<br />A week after the first application there was no reduction in infestation but by the second week I started to notice less & less of the little vermin. By the time I was ready to do a third application there was not even one white fly or any other insect on any of my roses or any other shrub. I had even used it on potted plants which were also infested & it worked on everything.<br />Remember, the product is systemic and is absorbed gradually into the plant so you will not see an immediate improvement but it works wonderfully.  Also if like me, you don't always remember to spray regularly or get the underneaths of the leaves, then something which you can sprinkle at the base of the plant every 6-8 weeks is certainly a lot easier to use."

We have a Teavana account and often purchase their 'German Rock Sugar' because it dissolves really well in our tea without over-sweetening it.  I have also used this is in my coffee, and baked products that require yeast to activate in water for 10-12 minutes.  In all cases, this sugar is perfect.  Compared to the outrageous price at Teavana and my local gorcery stores, I am saving over $3.00 per pound when I buy this online, and the quality is easily equal to, or greater than what we used to get.  There really isn't much to say about this product besides it is perfect, does everything I need it to do, at a much cheaper price."

One Splenda tube is almost as sweet as 3 sugar packages (3 spoons of sugar) and saves me from unnecessary sugar consumption. Hazelnut flavor smells amazing. Taste is great too but it also depends on the coffee used. In my experience, it goes best with Nescafe, other instant coffee brands did not make such an amazing taste with this item. And for some reason, no Splenda product goes well with brewed coffee."

B001PMC3PM,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,Chandler,119,120,5,2009-06-17,Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it."

I bought the unit from my local Staples for one hundred thirty-nine dollars, tax included. This model comes highly rated by both office and home users, and I couldn't find a single review online complaining of the broken water pump problem that seems to plague many Keurig models. The Cuisinart Keurigs were great, but neither of them lasted beyond the four month mark, which is terrible considering they cost around two hundred dollars a piece. They each just gradually stopped brewing full cups of coffee, and it seemed as though the pump just stopped doing its job of pushing water through the machine. Anyhow, the OfficePro B145 model is bulletproof and every component feels solid to the touch. It does not hold as much water as the Cuisinart Keurig, but I'll get over it. It is also considerably louder than the Cuisinart model as it doesn't have the QuietBrew technology, but I think the QuietBrew technology may be the ""Achilles heel"" of the Cuisinart Keurigs and other Keurig models as the pumps simply don't last. There are just too many reviews online for many Keurig models complaining of broken pumps. I'll update this review if I experience any problems, but, for now, I'm loving this bad boy!"

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.  I take it at night and it improves my otherwise slow system by the morning.  I continued being skeptical but noticed a marked improvement in my sleeping (more relaxed) and some muscle damage I had in my leg quickly healed (after one year of pain from an injury!).  I started off slow and had to graduate to a high dose - appx 3-4 tsp per day (was having serious constipation) -- after a week or so, I tapered down to a normal dose. I got my husband hooked on this stuff for the 'relaxing' effect alone (he is on the higher energy side).  It's subtle, not a drugged feeling when I say relaxing effect ... it's similar to melatonin without any groggy feeling.  My primary use is for constipation ... no more garbage over the counter drugs.  I never found improvement from pro-biotics either. This stuff helps with bloating and overall ""uggh"" feeling.  We both really like the taste, too.  If you like it more sweet/sour, then just use less water.  It's an artificial type sweetener, so no calories ... and I normally hate artificial sweetener taste, but it's hidden well.  It's similar to crystal light ... we get the raspberry/lemon flavor.

Unfortunately, the brand I picked up randomly <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376W6BK"">Lipton Green Tea, 100% Natural, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> kept leaving a bitter after-taste in my mouth. It was one of those things I had to force myself to drink. So not fun.<br /><br />But then *drumroll* I found Bigelow Green Tea with Lemon! I loved it. It was as refreshing as it was soothing, all this without any unhealthy/artificial additions. Drinking this product frequently throughout the day worked wonders for my sore throat and health-o-meter, and converted me into a die-hard fan. My morning cuppa tea and quiet time is a prized part of my routine now. I heart this product, and oh yea, it's not that expensive either. I just pick up individual 20-ct boxes at Walmart for $2.04 every so often.<br /><br />By the way, here's the lazy person's three-step process of drinking this tea - Boil 1 cup of water in the microwave for about 1-2 minutes. Immediately drop in the teabag and let steep for 3-5 minutes. Enjoy your lovely cup of freshness."

I actually purchased the two 1-Pound Bags instead of the one big glass jar. At the time I purchased, that was actually a little bit cheaper by ounce. Also, it comes in two packages, and the unopened one seems to be sealed well.

It will be the perfect late afternoon snack for those days that I am craving sugar and/or chocolate at work.  Overall though, I like the Cranberry Almond the best and repeatedly go back to it as a staple for those times I skipped breakfast, need a snack, I'm on the road, etc. The Madagascar Vanilla is very good as is the Pomegranate Blueberry. Not so thrilled with the Mango and Apricot versions.  I've shopped around locally and online and Amazon seems to be the best place to buy them in terms of price, especially if you put them on Subscription. Kind's line of Grains is also good... The Maple Walnut is perfect heated in the microwave like oatmeal.

I grind my own coffee beans, have my own herb garden and use loose leaf teas 95% of the time.  I live in a rural area that doesn't have a Starbucks on every corner.  I have to travel 35 miles to the nearest Starbucks and even then I am loathe to spend $5.00 for a cup of coffee, Starbucks brand or not.<br /><br />However, I thought this coffee was some of the best ground and flavored coffee that I had ever brewed at home.  I LOVE vanilla and when you open the package you can even SEE the ground vanilla bean in the coffee.<br /><br />The coffee was very smooth and sweet and I just really loved the REAL ORGANIC vanilla taste.  When reading some of the other reviews, people said they couldn't taste or smell the vanilla in this coffee.  That's because most people are used to artificial vanilla flavorings or vanilla extracts (i.e. alcohol based) instead of whole bean vanilla.<br /><br />This coffee also has Indian Sarsaparilla Root as an ingredient. Sarsaparilla root comes from the sarsaparilla plant, a woody-climbing vine that grows in South America, the West Indies, Mexico and other tropical parts of the world. Sarsaparilla root has a pleasant fragrance and a spicy sweet taste that pairs well with the coffee bean used and the vanilla bean.<br /><br />All in all this coffee makes a lovely ""cuppa"" and I would DEFINITELY buy this coffee and serve it again!<br /><br />Happy Brewing!"

The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker).

B0046IIPMW,AE8A5FC6PK3VM,Jeni,3,3,5,2012-02-12,Highly recommended!,I was on the lookout for an organic ghee after reading the health benefits of the ancient product. Amazon was the place to find it instead of racing all over town to track it down or make my own. I am so pleased with this product...it is so very flavorful and excellent for cooking! I use it instead of oil and usually always now instead of butter in many dishes...including pancakes...really packed with a yummy flavor - and a little goes a long way!

They have a great flavor, are crunchy and hold up well to dunking. They taste much better than Nabisco and most store brands. We have a box of the Nabisco Honey Graham Crackers and I definitely prefer the Back to Nature Graham Crackers. The Nabisco (and most others) have a somewhat bland flavor where the Back to Nature have a very good flavor that is noticeable. I have a sweet tooth and these would definitely satisfy it and would also be much healthier but I would still prefer these even if they weren't healthier."

It is not only good for you, it has a wonderful flavor in low temp cooking(from eggs to oatmeal), used as a spread, in morning smoothies(adds a crunch as well because it hardens when cooled) and in baking!  Amazon has the best price consistently and Natures  is the best product.  I have it on my auto ship program and love it!"

I also use it for my body, face and hair.  Not sure about all the healthy hype but it is a must try product.  You do have to get use to the consistency depending on the weather it could be in a liquid form or hard.  It is a great moisturizer I have very dry skin, after 2-3 minutes you no longer feel oily and the slight smell of coconut also disappears.  I do moisturize before I go to bed not sure if I would do it in the morning before I get dress for work, I would be worried it might ruin my clothes.

Although they don't taste like standard pasta, they're a wonderful substitute for when you have carb cravings.  The fishy smell rinses right away and they absorb the flavor of the sauce.  A little on the strange side with texture - 'rubbery' sounds worse than it is, but I can't figure out another description.  Still really enjoy them.  I use udon seasoning packets or boullion usually, but pasta sauce works well. I find that if you rinse and prepare them, then allow to sit an hour or so to absorb the flavor, it works really well.  Toss them in the microwave and voila!  Great product."

Oh how I was wrong. These are delicious. They're fluffy, creamy and taste great. The only thing that could make these better would be if they were organic.<br /><br />They were pricey (at least locally, at the moment Amazon is out of stock so I don't know their pricing) but I would definitely buy these again."

So I've tried about 5 high-quality Keurig options by now, trying to find that dark taste without going into gross and overdone. I'd never have guessed it from the name, but this one does it.  Obviously, it helps to try them out yourself. But for what it's worth, I find a lot of the ones labelled French or Italian roast aren't dark, they are just overly strong...like dumping hot sauce on a dish, not getting the flavors right.<br /><br />The bonus of the K-cup system is, I can make myself a cup of coffee so fast I don't really lose the momentum of my work.  The downside is, I don't have that nice espresso-making ritual to give my eyes and brain a rest.  ALMOST enough to make me dig out the espresso maker."

The baby is 5 months now and my daughter tried switching between the soy, gassless, regular formula and the baby would still scream and scream and in a painful state.  This formula is more expensive but it is worth a peaceful night for both mom and baby.  Baby does still spit up some but is in a better spirit with this formula.  Yes it is expensive but there is a reason why it is more expensive.  We did try another brand of the hypoallergenic and also had good results with it and it was also expensive."

We have been feeding it to our husky/ German Shepherd mix for almost 6 months, and she the healthy weight and lean body that you want for a large breed at her age.<br /><br />She had some diarrhea and digestive issues with other foods, but Wellness fixed that problem.  Though this food has some sweet potato in it (a bad ingredient for her), it is low enough. Whenever our pup starts to have digestive problems from a new snack, we back off and feed her only her Wellness chow, and the problem goes away in a day or so.<br /><br />We can even use this doggy food as a treat for training because she is extremely food-driven.  I also love that it is a dry food that is easy to carry around in my pocket as a treat, or on trips where we bring her a meal.  I highly recommend it to owners who care very much about feeding their pets quality food."
B0051COPH6,A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,J. Offenbach,0,0,5,2012-05-02,Much more than food for babies,"I have no more babies at home, but was curious to try the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPH6"">Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1(6 Months+) Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> for several reasons.  Firstly, I bake a lot and use applesauce or pureed prunes instead of oil and/or sugar in some recipes.  Secondly, my mother is unable to chew much these days, and I was thinking of sending some purees to help my folks achieve better nutrition.  Thirdly, having recently experienced some GI problems, I wanted to have pureed foods in my pantry in case I have another flare-up that necessitates a temporary change to soft foods in my diet.  Since I had relied on some pureed baby foods in the past, I liked the option of BPA free packaging that appeared to take up less storage space and the ingredient list was enticing.<br /><br />Well, the glowing praise I read about Baby Gourmet Organic foods on the web has it right!  Stage 1 foods are sold for 6 month old infants, and I wish these had been available when my daughter was young.  I would have saved so much time as I routinely pulled out the Happy Baby Food Grinder to prepare her nourishment!  I find the green vegetable flavor in this puree to be slight, not as strong as plain broccoli and spinach, with the pear sweetening it just right -- good combination for newly developing baby palates.  Now on to my experiences... I used this product in baking zucchini bread and it was outstanding!  I've frozen a couple pouches, then sliced them open for an ""instant sorbet"" of sorts.  It was quite good and I'm sure that if one has dental work done or is recovering from an ailment, this will be a welcome food source.  Regardless, it's a swell summer treat.<br /><br />The removable cap is small, so if you do have kids as most consumers likely do, I'd recommend taking care with its safety.  Being able to easily close the pouch is a strength, particularly since each pouch contains two servings for an infant.  The pouch should not be microwaved, but placed in hot water if warming desired.  This food has gained my approval and I'm preparing to order some for my mother.  I'll likely send <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPGW"">Baby Gourmet Organic Yummy Combos  Stage 2 (7 Months +)  Baby's Sweet Potato Pie Baby Food, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> because I think it will be a great addition to her morning oatmeal!"

I'm diabetic, so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just can't happen as often as I'd like to do so.  But these are tasty enough to get me through until I can 'carb budget'  the real thing. These are made with sugar alcohols, so it's wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless you're going to be near home and have turbo-flush on your toilet.  (TMI???)

But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!"

They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag, 3 grams of fat (no saturated, no trans fat), 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50-something are fans.<br /><br />I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself."
B0004M1FGW,A26HFSVLAGULIM,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""",5,5,5,2005-09-15,GREAT WAY TO TAKE A REALLY HEALTHY DRINK ON THE ROAD,"If you are looking for taste, nutrition, and low carbs/calories, this beverage is for you. Add to that low sodium in this particular variation and you have a drink we should all be drinking. I was always a bit reluctant to indulge in this yummy veg-fest because of the huge amount of added sodium, but now the low-sodium product has become much more available and costs only 30% more than the original high-sodium version. Typically, this low-sodium, mixed 100% vegetable juice is the type of drink that sells for $2-4 at a juice bar per 8-ounce serving or about $8-$10 per quart from a health food store in bottles. WHY?<br /><br />There are more than 8 reasons WHY V8 is so special -- Tomatoes, Beets, Celery, Carrots, Lettuce, Parsley, Watercress and Spinach are the first eight. Low carbs/calories and no added sugar are the 9th and 10th reasons. Low sodium and the resulting favorable potassium/sodium ratio give this particular version an 11th reason to become a truly 5-star product. Also, the 17 mg. of naturally-occurring lycopene in an 8-ounce serving is more than the average amount that you would find in single-nutrient lycopene supplements which cost an average of 16 cents per pill and which are less bio-available than the naturally-occurring lycopene in the V8 juice. With all the naturally occurring vitamins, minerals, and anti-oxidants in ""V8 100% Vegetable Juice"", this is a really healthy dietetic treat as an in-between snack.<br /><br />If you are not allergic to the ingredients [e.g., tomato allergy], this is the most practical and convenient way to add a very healthy serving of mixed vegetables to your diet. This variety in a small can is a little pricey, but it is very convenient and your body will thank you.<br /><br />TASTING THE CAN????<br /><br />Some people mentioned that they tasted the can. I always pour the contents out of the can when I first open it, unless I am going to finish it in one gulp. The aluminium in the container does leach into the acidic vegetable drink due to oxidation once it is opened, so remove it or drink it ASAP. The bottles all have an expiration date stamped on them, but since I do not have the cans on hand I can't say for sure whether they do as well."

I am HOOKED! I buy one to two cans a week - they are about $4.50-$6 at my local grocery stores. I wasn't interested in the ""digestive health"" label and didn't think it would help. I usually ""go"" every other day or so...well let's just say I have been ""going"" everyday with ease. Forget painful laxatives or crazy cleansers...this product will help your own body to naturally do what it's suppose to. If you love the taste of healthy granola cereals, you will love the granola clusters in this mix. There are also delicious green pistacios. The cranberries are not too hard, not too soft, and taste great. If you aren't interested in your health, eating better, and you still prefer cheese puffs and coca-cola all day, you may not like this product. If you are like my family and I (seen members have heart attacks, diabetes, and learned junk food just isn't worth it anymore), then you will love this product. As you know, almonds are a great source of the healthy fats your heart needs. The berries contain anti-oxidants that your body needs. I would not suggest eating the whole can the 1st time you buy this product...you will spend the next day in the ""office"". I suggest eating an ounce or so as a daily snack.

I've found that I prefer a shorter steeping time vs. most other black loose teas. There is some inconsistency between batches even from the same bag. Sometimes you get more Bergamot oil flavor, sometimes more lavender and tannins. This might be a consequence of inconsistency in steeping times or tea quantity on my part, but I think it's actually the tea itself. I like the variety as it keeps me from getting bored. I tend to prefer ~2 minutes steeping in my French press and reuse it 2 or 3 times. The 2nd steeping is often the best.<br /><br />For under $20 per lb, I'd be happy if this were just OK tea. However, it's actually quite good. It is certainly the best value I've found so far."

I have tried several soup mixes on amazon.com & the Leonard Mountain soups are my favorite by far! 5+ stars :)"

McCann's is more like a meal than a bowl of cereal.  The tins are also great for long-term storage so I keep them coming on a subscription basis.  The Quick and Easy variety is also delicious and cooks up quickly.  Cooking several servings at once is simple.  Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and then add 2 cups of oatmeal, reduce heat and cover for 5 minutes stirring often. After cooling, refrigerate and enjoy as a cold snack throughout the day or nuke and enjoy hot. Add whatever treats you enjoy most.  Splenda and blueberries are my favorite additives.  I get about 90 miles per bowl."
B000RHT0DY,A1G941AVCMPLLR,Mary Bausch,0,2,5,2009-08-06,Great buy!,"Wasabi Mayonnaise livens up cold cut, tuna and chicken salad sandwiches, and it is very hard to find.  Even when you do, if you check the ingredients you will likely find that the jarred product does not specify wasabi root.  This product contains horseradish, green coloring and other ingredients.  You dissolve the powder in water making a paste, and add to regular mayonnaise. Mix well.  Devise a proportion to suit your taste. Start off with modest amounts of the paste.  The 14 oz container will go a long way."
B000ORXYYS,A1DFKPWO9HVT1M,findapenny,85,85,5,2010-08-13,DEEEEEElicious!  My new favorite sweetener,"I've tried several brands of Xylitol and only disliked one (""Ideal"") because it contained other ingredients. This brand does not. The granules are sugar sized and it tastes like sugar and can be used like sugar. I even put it in my coffee bean grinder to see if I could turn it into powdered sugar and it worked (very quickly) and was delicious. The down side is that it became very hard a couple days later, but that may happen with regular sugar too...I know that powdered sugar is sugar plus an ingredient to keep it ""powdery"" so this shouldn't be held against Xylitol.<br /><br />Several things worth knowing about Xylitol:<br /><br />1. It is very hard to tell the difference between Xylitol and sugar, both by the way it looks and the way it tastes. The only real difference is that it has a cooling effect on your tongue, rather like mint. It tastes like sugar on your tongue but I've found when cooking/baking with it, it takes a little bit extra (maybe 10%) to achieve the same sweetness. Also, it doesn't caramelize when heated. Xylitol definitely does not have a chemical taste to it like other sweeteners, which makes sense because it's not a synthesized product like other sweeteners. I far prefer it because I don't expect to hear about discoveries in ten or twenty years from now that it causes cancer or tumors.<br /><br />2. If you want an artificial sweetener for diet purposes and don't care about chemicals, this probably isn't your best bet.  It has fewer calories than sugar by about 40% but the artificial sweeteners have fewer calories. (I personally think chemicals are far more hazardous than calories, but to each his own!)<br /><br />3. It kills harmful bacteria. A great use for this is dental care (you'll find it as an ingredient in many mouthwashes, toothpastes, and gum) and it works very well. I dip my toothpasted toothbrush into Xylitol sometimes when my mouth hasn't been feeling clean and after brushing my teeth, they feel smooth like after a dentist visit. Possibly the slightly abrasive effect of brushing with crystals has something to do with it but my mouth also feels pretty clean after drinking hot cocoa made with Xylitol and that's not the case when I make it with sugar. I use Xylitol because I have Candida and I can use the help killing it!<br /><br />4. It is known to soften the stool and I have personally found this to be true. I told a friend about it and he now eats Xylitol specifically for this purpose, something I hadn't thought of. So one person's downside is another person's upside! I don't know if this is a universal effect but I would recommend keeping your intake small (a tablespoon or less) for a few days to see how it impacts your system. I baked a cake with it and didn't have a problem (and ate probably 1/4 cup of Xylitol that day) but I'm not sure if that was attributable to the baking or some other reason, perhaps the softening effect is achieved with a small amount and larger amounts don't increase it."
B000CQG8AS,A70NFM6KHU24F,Trevor Burnham,2,2,5,2009-03-17,Delicious green tea,"The trouble with many mint teas is that the minty flavoring overpowers the underlying tea leaves. Too often, mint is used to make inferior tea taste palatable. Stash's Mint Green Tea is different. It has a rich and well-rounded flavor, which I prefer to that of their flowery plain green tea. And the price is quite reasonable for such a refreshing beverage, especially if you use Amazon's Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />As the weather warms up, this versatile tea is well-suited to both hot and iced brewing. I would recommend it over any other bagged tea."

B000ED9LPS,A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G,Once in a while,12,13,5,2010-09-17,"So good, I don't want to tell you about it!","I'm reluctant to share all the recipes of things we're using Bob's Red Mill potato flour for. Why? Because they're so good, once people try them, it might start selling out!<br /><br />Oh, what the heck. You talked me into it. I'll share a couple of them anyway.<br /><br />For delicious gluten/grain-free chicken nuggets:<br /><br />Start with a pound of skinless, boneless chicken, cut into nugget-sized pieces. We use dark meat, because it comes out moister and more flavorful. Pat the pieces with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.<br /><br />Next, combine the following in a quart-size Zip Lock bag. You can adjust the seasonings to your own taste, of course:<br /><br />1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp Bob's Red Mill potato flour<br />1 tsp salt<br />1 tsp onion powder<br />1/2 tsp garlic powder<br />1/2 tsp paprika<br />1/2 tsp white or black pepper<br />1/2 tsp dried parsley flakes, crushed to powder<br /><br />Put half the chicken pieces in the bag, zip it closed and toss gently to coat the chicken. Remove the chicken pieces, shaking off the excess coating back into the bag, and cook them in a little oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.<br /><br />It's important to cook over medium-low heat like that, because potato flour can scorch. Using tongs or a fork, turn the pieces occasionally until lightly browned and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.<br /><br />Once you try chicken made with potato flour like this, you may never want chicken made with wheat flour again. :)<br /><br />For a quick and easy, dairy-free, gluten-free, tapioca-like pudding -- yes, pudding:<br /><br />Bring 1-and-a-half cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add a pinch of salt and 1/4 tsp baking soda to the water. (The baking soda will neutralize the potato ""tang"" of potato flour.) Add a generous dash of vanilla extract.<br /><br />In a small bowl, use a fork to stir together a quarter cup plus 2 tbsps of white sugar, and a quarter cup plus 1 tbsp of Bob's Red Mill potato flour.<br /><br />Remove the saucepan from the heat (this is important -- you don't want the thickening mixture to boil and spatter on you). Gradually pour the dry ingredients from the bowl into the hot water, stirring the water with a fork to mix while you do. The mixture will thicken instantly.<br /><br />(No matter how much you stir, there will be some lumps. So if you don't like lumps, either don't bother with this recipe, or take an extra step of pushing the mixture through a sieve.)<br /><br />Allow the pudding to cool. We usually hasten that process by placing the saucepan in a sink half filled with cold water.<br /><br />We also use potato flour as an extender for wheat-free meat loaf, and as an extender and coating for chicken-fried steak. (Cook in a skillet with a little oil over medium low heat so the potato flour doesn't scorch.)<br /><br />We also ---<br /><br />Okay, I'm not going to tell you any more. I've said too much already. Now don't go buying up all my Bob's Red Mill potato flour!"

An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.<br /><br />I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz).  While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh.

I could never stand to drink it alone, but I can't drink *any* flavored K-Cups alone, as they're ALL woffee (water/weak coffee).  I could say take a chance on this, if you don't like it, mix it with a strong cup of coffee (decaf if you don't want to be wired all day) and you'll like it!"

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br /><br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

I've bought the venison & green pea flavor and the salmon & green pea flavor, and they love both.  I haven't bought the duck version because I've read it was patte which I don't think my cats will like, while these two have more of a 'meaty' texture.  And I just haven't tried the chicken flavor because my cats' dry food is chicken flavor so I figured they'd be bored with that :).<br /><br />If your cat is picky of course they might not like this brand, that's always a risk with any food.  Sometimes cats have to be persuaded to try it out, but then once they do they like it. I'm sure you've read most of the ways to tempt cats to try a new food... but one way that I rarely saw mentioned was the way that finally worked for me with my oldest, who is very timid about anything new.  I found that if I put a tiny amount on top of one of her front paws (I smeared a dab into her fur with my finger), that more or less gave her no choice but to taste it because she wanted to lick it off to clean her paw.  Then immediately she was intrigued and started eating from the plate.  I did that with this brand and now she loves it, she stands at the fridge and cries when it's dinner time (they both do).<br /><br />Besides the fact that my cats love this brand and do well on it, I like that it's relatively cheap compared to other healthy brands. With Natural Balance I don't have to pay shipping costs like on most others, because Natural Balance is sold at Petco and also here on Amazon eligible for free shipping."

I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored.

It has no discernible metallic/chalky aftertaste that many of the fortified bars have (although this includes a good range of vitamins and minerals too), and contains the following macronutrients:<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Protein: 11g<br />Carb: 22g with 7g fiber and 9g sugar<br />Fat: 4.5g<br /><br />150 is just right for me, and 11 grams of protein with that calories profile is EXCELLENT.

Overall, excellent, healthy product from a candy brand."

ONLY at the ends of the hair, not the whole head.<br /><br />* Soothes those razor burns after shaving (even for men too!) - OUCH! Just a little dab will do ya!<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Want to be the greatest liar? SHHHHHH! Have a nice tan or turned into a Lobster - (whether for real to sprayed on) ... use some of this on some strands of your hair, after you had set your hair, then tussel it up with some SEA SALT added to it - but SHHH, be sure you wear Beach Bum outfit (you liar you and don't forget the Sun block! ;) .... for that added effect and smell!)  Just remember, if you hang out at the bars, just go to the RIGHT one!  (But of course, that's our little secret here - don't tell anyone or everyone else will be doing it! HAHAHAHAHA! Let the other guys and gals turn green with envy! :-D ...)<br /><br />--------<br /><br />Bad News - if you happened to wind up in a dilemma such as I did, with a head that looked like it had been slammed into an oil pit. GOOD NEWS - just add a cup of regular vinegar to rinse it off while in the shower (close eyes and/or keep head down and keep eyes closed), then add a warm unopened can of beer (no specific brand - a cheap one will do); pour on your hair (if your hair is very long, use the large can of beer), let it soak for 3 mins (short) to 5 mins (long) while you take a shower then rinse it out ... there you go, you've got your hair back and it's nice and soft like a baby's hair, but do not shampoo or use conditioner or treat afterwards until the next day. What Vinegar does - it strips all the oil out. What beer does, it restores the Ph balance into the hair; but it only lasts up to about 16 to 24 hours (longer time frame if dry hair, shorter span if oily).

After some experimenting and different recommendations, I tried Natural Balance and mix the wet and dry food and BOOM, she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />Additionally, on Amazon Prime you can have this shipped right to your door in two days and save a nice little chunk of money.<br /><br />I definitely give my stamp of approval and would recommend this dog food to anyone who is looking for high quality, appetizing dog food."

This one takes a little longer to make due to the need to marinate the meet for 20 minutes, and also because the recipe calls for 1/3 cup lemon curd (I had to Google this but found it easy to make from a few common ingredients). So while not exactly a ""heat and serve"" recipe, it is still easy and very delicious if you like Indian spices.  My wife and I both loved the strong flavors in the dish, but my wife found it a little bit on the spicy-hot side, while for me ""nothing is too hot"", and this dish was just moderately spicy.  I was tempted to substitute yogurt for the lemon curd, but was really glad I made the lemon curd like the recipe said, because I could taste the hint of lemon in the final product, and it was a really nice touch.  I highly recommend this meal if you like strong flavored spice, and enjoy moderately spicy-hot foods."

To tell you the truth, I didn't find that thought unappealing, so I ordered it.<br /><br />My verdict?  It's a delicious coffee, and though stronger than a lot of coffees, I found it very drinkable and am entirely happy with it.  It's strong, but not at all offensive.  I think it has a pleasant taste, no strong aftertaste, and though I will admit it probably has a bit more kick than, say, my wife's Donut Shop coffee, I'm not buzzed on it.<br /><br />Incidentally, I think the only way to get K-cup coffee is to order it on subscription in order to get the 15 % markdown.  Be aware that even subscription prices are available to rise (and fall, I suppose) with the market.  I had thought the price was locked in, but I was wrong.<br /><br />I love K-cups, and I also love Amazon, but unless the prices drop soon, I'm going to have to buy them at Bed, Bath and Beyond...they're not too expensive over there, and they're always having 20 % off or $5 off coupons, as well as sales, and that is about the only way to get K-cups cheap.  I'd rather use Amazon, but paying 60 cents and more for each cup is ri-freaking-diculous."

It's great iced in the spring with a little True Lemon.<br /><br />As with all green teas, be careful not to ""cook"" the tea. If your water's too hot, it'll produce tea that's bitter and unpleasant.

I wanted a black that I could use without having to start with chocolate icing (birthday girl does not like chocolate!). It turned snow-white marshmallow fondant BLACK, with very little of the gel and no noticeable taste difference. I was afraid that the coloring would leave my hands purple or blue, but the only place I noticed a stain was where I touched the full-strength coloring directly--once I mixed it in with the melted marshmallow before mixing the powdered sugar in to make the fondant, there were not problems with stains. I can't say if it would stain stone counters, though--I was not brave enough to test it on my granite, and so I kneaded the fondant on wax paper. Like other reviewers, I was a Wilton fan for years, but love this new alternative and will definitely be using AmeriColor from now on."

It doesn't have the funny, woody, or bitter after tastes that a lot of the other less expensive brands (Folgers, Taster's Choice) have. Very good when mixed with a good hot chocolate and a little milk or non-dairy creamer. Bonus is a good caffeine kick when compared to the flavored instants."

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""",1,3,5,2008-12-01,12 cats later.....,"With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product!<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- one Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Sole Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Yellow Fin Tuna Entr&eacute;e<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included an equal number of each flavor) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the ""gravy"" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the chunks of seafood. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e: fish broth, Tuna filets, Red Snapper Fillets, soy bean oil, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Carrageenan, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 13%, crude fat (min) 1.5%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%, taurine (min) 0.1%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on all four flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended."

This is a strong coffee, a caffe lungo is a ""long coffee"" or big coffee that Europeans drink. It's like their everyday coffee. The caffe lungo is meant to be a stronger tasting, somewhat bitter coffee. It means business. So if you like a strong, slightly bitter coffee in the morning like I do, it's wonderful. Now. Because the Dolce Gusto machine lets YOU decide how much water to add, you can further control the strength and therefore bitterness. Obviously, the more water you add, the more mild the coffee will be. I suggest that when you first get the machine, you experiment with strength by using a pyrex measuring cup. They suggest adding 4oz of water, but obviously you can add however much or however little water your heart desires to suit your tastes. Apparently, Europeans are not sitting around enjoying big mugs like Americans are. I think they simply drink more cups throughout the day.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a wonderful, full-bodied and slightly bitter coffee. I makes a wonderful crema layer. (the froth you get from a pressure-brewed coffee) You certainly can't get this from a k-cup or Keurig (drip brew) system.

B000WFUL3E,A3F45B9WS0JO5F,Morrison,1,1,5,2012-06-29,My cats now love it!,"I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food. Wellness fit the bill. The younger cat ate up the chicken flavor instantly and loved it! The older cat however, refused to eat it at first. She was used to eating dry kibbles and occasionally canned fancy feast. She kept refusing to eat the Wellness and I caved in and let her finish the bag of kibbles. Only when we didn't have any other food than the canned wellness did she approach it. So once she was good and hungry, and the younger cat was in another room, she crept out and started eating it!! Now she loves it and eats the chicken flavor with no problem. I haven't tried out the other flavors, but since I had such a hard time getting her to come around to eating it in the first place, I've been feeding them both the chicken flavor exclusively. If your cat won't eat Wellness, be patient and get rid of their previous food so when they get hungry they only have one choice. Mixing the old food with the new one wasn't as successful as just waiting it out. Their coats are super shiny and they are both at a healthy weight on a wellness diet."

Because it's a japanese product, and the packing fluid that smells neutral to the japanese smells fishy to us.

There is absolutely no fishy odor or flavor (or ANY odor or flavor, for that matter) to properly rinsed and parboiled Shiritaki noodles.<br /><br />These noodles just add texture and filling to your meal. Add them to soup or stir fry, serve them with grilled meat... they're an excellent complement to a carb-free or low-calorie diet. Just don't expect them to taste like spaghetti. They make you feel full, and the fiber is good for you.<br /><br />The noodles are totally fine stored at room temperature for a month or two. They last even longer in the fridge.<br /><br />Some Shiritaki noodles have tofu in addition to the glucomannan, and therefore have calories.

The ""Hoofer"" is the whole hoof of a bovine, the toes with the bones and meat and skin all there. It is dried and not cured, which I am really pleased with. Because it is the whole foot I wouldn't recommend this for dogs that like to swallow large pieces off of their chews. For my small dog it is great!<br /><br />It doesn't smell bad like sometimes just the clipped hoof can, and infact even when my dog has been chewing on it for a long session I don't notice it being smelly. I've had rawhides after being chewed smell pretty bad (from the curing chemicals I guess?) but this hoofer doesn't smell gross. Even though it has more stuff in it than just a rawhide it doesn't get super stinky, a big plus for our apartment since we can't leave chews outside.<br /><br />Over all I recommend this hoofer as a good alternative to rawhides. If you have a big dog you may want to monitor them since it does have the toe bones inside and there are many and they are small.<br /><br />My dog hasn't splintered anything on this but again he is only 16lbs and is not a ""power chewer"", the red kongs are just fine for him. I would monitor closely if your dog is a ""power chewer"" just to be safe, but my dog is still working on this after month and there aren't any cracks in the karatin."

The reviews were good for this brand, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I am so glad that I did!<br /><br />The most important thing is that this tuna tastes delicious.  For a quick sandwich, I just mix it with a little bit of mayo, and that's all it needs.  You can probably eat this right out of the can, if that is your preference.  With a little bit of diced red onion and diced celery, this is even better.  I have tried most of my supermarket's brands, and this beats it bar-none.  This tuna is also denser and comes in what I would describe as a ""tuna steak.""  It can be a bit more challenging to mash, but it is worth it.<br /><br />Secondly, this is some very guilt-free tuna.  Firstly, it is sustainably caught.  Secondly, this tuna has the lowest amount of mercury, so you don't have to worry about mercury levels as much.  And, of course, last but not least, this brand's canning process retains all the good-for-you omega-3 oils without adding any liquid.  There is no need to drain (and in fact, it's better for you if you don't).<br /><br />The price is higher than your run of the mill tuna, but it is worth it for what you are getting."

The 5 pounds is the drained weight and they are fresh, firm, tasty and not too salty.  There is a minimal amount of liquid, and I've not seen any that are mushy.  I separated the olives into jars for three and put the remaining half (yes that's right, half) into a FoodSaver medium sized cannister and vacuum sealed that one.  I gave two of the jars away and received great thanks and praise for this thrifty online purchase of high quality olives.  The spices are minimal, which was a concern of mine.

Each box comes with a 3.5 ouch pouch of the Tandoori spice mixture which goes a very long way. I did try to make it per the instructions for making the Chicken Masala but found it a bit too much spice all over the meat. However, I have discovered a perfect use for it. We toss it into vegetables that we roast in the oven. I've used it to coat and toast assorted nuts for snacks. It's rich, smokey and wonderfully flavorful. You can make it as heavy or light as you wish. Basic recipe..veggies scrubbed and chopped in 1 inch chunks: 3 large regular potatoes,3 large sweet potatoes, 2 onions, 1# bag baby carrots, 1 large bunch fresh broccoli in pieces. This is my favorite mixture. I then toss all the veggies in a huge bowl with some sea salt, olive oil and about 2-4 Tablespoons of the spice mixture depending on the heat you want. It's not very spicy but a little does go a long way. Once all tossed and coated, on a large oiled baking sheet, I bake at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes, stir with a spatula and continue roasting until done...depending on thickness of veggies, it could take another 25 or more. This is FANTASTIC! You can use these veggies for pita pockets, with tortillas and eggs for breakfast burritos or even alone as a side dish. When our favorite Indian grocery store closed, I panicked and found this online so I could have a backstock. The best thing about getting a case of 12 is that there is enough to share and plenty for backstock. After roasting assorted nuts and seeds for salads, I shared them with a coworker who is also now hooked. For an interesting all purpose seasoning, this is top notch. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXTJ4S"">Badshah Masala, Tandoori Chicken, 3.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 12)</a>"

It seems almost wrong to put it in a can, but the flavor profile does hold up overall. This is primarily because unlike other canned drinks, this coffee is not super sweet or filled with strange ingredients. It has a little sugar, milk, and cocoa, none of which overpower the coffee, but instead balance it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of iced coffee with sugar and cream, you will likely enjoy this brand.  It is more coffee than dessert."

Mantilla,0,0,5,2012-07-18,So great to find a bully stick for sensitive/allergic dogs!,"I was hesitant to order the Canine Caviar Buffalo Stix based on other Amazon reviewers comments about some of their other ""stix"" products being flimsy or quickly eaten, but I researched this specific item on the Canine Caviar website and these are actually Bison pizzle, unlike other products which may be made from gullet or intestine and are less sturdy. Therefore, these are directly comparable to beef ""bully sticks.""<br /><br />I was pleased with the case of individually wrapped Buffalo Stix that I received. While the thickness varies, many are quite thick and are obviously of good quality. They do have a distinct odor, as all pizzle does, but it is not terribly overwhelming and seems to drive all my dogs into a frenzy. The price works out to be $1.50 per buffalo stick, which is more than the beef bully sticks, but that seems to be the case with any bison product.<br /><br />Most importantly, my allergy-prone dog absolutely loves them and they last longer than any other chew I have purchased for her (including trachea, scapula cartilage, jerky, etc.) She is a 50-lb medium-intensity chewer, so one stick will keep her completely and totally occupied for over an hour.  She was so engrossed with the last stick I gave her, I was able to take my other dog for a walk and come back to find her still chewing away blithely. (Don't worry, she wasn't unattended with a chew.)<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this product to other people with allergy-prone or picky dogs. I will definitely purchase this product again, especially if there are any special sales or discounts forthcoming. =)"

I made homemade vanilla extract, I put 1-2 vanilla beans in my cookies (which I make at an ungodly rate!), in ice cream, and various other treats and I only ran out in Feb. of this year! so it took me two years to go through 1 lb! I love these vanilla beans. They are fragrant and moist. After I scrape the beans I throw them in my sugar container. The sugar absorbs the moisture from the spent hulls and the end result is a very fragrant vanilla flavored sugar! If I have too many on hand I will let them dry out and throw them in a spice grinder, until they become a fine powder. It is great to sprinkle in coffee or on top of oatmeal or waffles in the morning! vanilla beans are too expensive to waste so use up as much of it as you can! Make sure you store them in an air tight container! You want to keep them moist. I bought an OXO Good Grips POP container just for the purpose of storing my vanilla beans.<br /><br />and just a note...even though I clicked the same link I originally purchased the beans from in 2010 and they came from a different company...International Spice Holdings LLP. AND even when I go to my orders to leave the review (it even says International Spice Holdings LLP  on the invoice) it brings me to the JR Mushrooms & Specialties page!!

But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br /><br />After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br /><br />And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added ""flavored coffee creamer"" to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod."

B0015VTGEO,A3FY3H6F4249E0,Kathy W,1,2,5,2011-03-28,Excellent Drink,"This is Zola Acai with blueberry juice.  It is a 12 FL. Oz (354 ML) plastic bottle with an easy open twist off cap.  It is quite tasty, quite pleasant, just sweet enough and not overbearing.  (I hate things that are sickening sweet and I hate things that have the artificial sugars like aspartame and such.  This is neither.)  The bottle suggests you serve it cold.  I just threw it in my bag and took off for work.  I drank it at room temperature.  (It may be tastier when cold but it was great at room temp.) I selected this flavor because of the alleged health benefits of both Acai and Blueberry.<br /><br />The bottle says all kinds of good things:  All natural, USDA organic, Brazilian Superfruits.  Each bottle provides 1200 mg Omega 3, 6, and 9 Fatty Acids.  (That was pretty impressive and it was a lot tastier than those wild salmon vitamin tablets for Omegas--burp--ewww.) Ingredients in order listed (1st listed is supposed to be highest concentration of, and down the list): Organic Acai Pulp, Organic Evap Cane Juice, Organic Blueberry Juice Concentrate, Organic Guarana (24 mg natural caffeine), Citric Acid, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors.  There are 1 1/2 servings in a bottle, so calories for the bottle are about 146.  An 8 oz serving includes 1.5g total fat, .5 is saturated fat, 0 mg cholesterol, 26 mg sodium, 18 mg potassium, 27 total carbs (1g being dietary fiber and 20g sugars, and 1g protein. An 8 oz serving contains 4% vitamin A, 15% vitamin C, 2% calcium, 10% iron, 10 % vitamin E.  93% juice.  Refrigerate after opening (but you'll likely drink the whole thing--the bottle is only 6 1/2 inches tall.  It is produced in the USA and distributed from California.<br /><br />I think that pretty much says it all.  I will not hesitate to buy this product again.  I will not hesitate to try the other flavors available.  It is a good drink to bring for lunch at work (or a liquid snack).  If I had a school child, I believe it would make a nice, healthy drink to pack with his/her lunch."

Some cats like it, some cats don't. My cat isn't picky. My problem was that it smelled so sordid that I couldn't stand to feed my cat (read my review on it here). Since my cat liked the ""other"" formula so well, I decided to try the original formula in the ""green bag"". I found a good price locally and the pet shop owner told me about how the ""green bag"" was far superior to the ""other one"".<br /><br />And she was right.

The Pomegranate is the stronger smell, overwhelming the apple. The fizz isn't nearly as fizzy as Martinelli's, and the taste is sharp with a strong bite. The Pomegranate gives it a fair amount of acidity without too much of a tang. The bite overwhelms the finish as it fizzles away. The apple can be tasted, but acts more to tone down the pomegranate. It went very well with the lemon chicken we had, which was already pretty acidic. The Chicken was pretty light, yet still strongly acidic, and this Sparkler went well with it. It's sweet, but much dryer than any of the other sparkling juices we've had, and cleanses the palette much like the dealcoholized wines I've had. Less of a soda than other sparkling juices I've tried so far, with smaller bubbles. It's not flat, just finer. This doesn't have a head, while the others generally have a bit of one. This one also has continues tiny bubbles drifting upwards, where the others I've tried so far (Welch's Red and their White sparkling juices, as well as R.W. Knudsen's Sparkling Pear Juice and Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Grape) just have bubbles that are stagnant, attached to the side of the glass (in general.)<br /><br />Did I like it: Yes, both my wife and I enjoyed it quite a bit. 9 out of 10."

I had originally planned to pass on this variety, but thought I may as well give it a try.  As the days went on I tried each of the varieties one by one and really enjoyed them.  Then finally I got to the DB Earl Grey.  I didn't have high expectations for it, but let me tell you -- I was absolutely blown away by this tea.  It is perhaps the best tasting, most full-bodied and yet elegant tea (I know that's a strange word to describe tea with) I've ever tasted.  If you like regular Earl Greys, you will LOVE this tea.  You can tell the Bergamot oil is of very high quality.  Take your time to inhale the scent of the tea bag before you even start brewing -- it's that good.  The taste cannot be compared to any other Earl Grey I've had, and I've had some very good ones.  And you can brew quite a large cup (like a double tea-cup size) with one bag.  This tea is very full-bodied, so if you like your teas weaker, don't leave it brewing for too long.  They did not skimp on this tea and you really owe it to yourself to give it a try."

Lipton is a brand I have used since childhood, and a brand I trust.  I have tried their other flavored teas using the pyramid shaped tea bag, and I love them.<br /><br />The pyramid shaped bag allows me to get full flavor of the tea.  Typically, I use my Keurig to dispense a cup of plain hot water into a mug that contains the tea bag.  If I plan on sweetening the tea, I add the sweetener as the water dispenses, so that it fully dissolves into the flavor of the tea.  For me this is a tried and true method for a quick cup that is the perfect temperature.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the pairing of blackberry and vanilla flavors.  Because I added sweetener, I did not find this tea at all bitter, on the contrary the flavor was quite lovely.  I added a bit of milk and the tea was a lovely lilac color in my mug.  The flavor and aroma both proved very relaxing.  All in all, a nice, mellow bodied taste that will become a permanent part of my tea repertoire."

People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it (""they've been eating Wellness for years!""), and end up blaming it on the company.<br /><br />It's not necessarily the company's fault. It's at least partially your fault for creating a routine in which you allowed your cat to become so finicky.<br /><br />As a human, there are a few brands I prefer simply because I grew up with them, and I know the taste of those brands blind-folded. I'm finicky about them.  Cats are *super*-sensitive and can taste even the smallest changes - including the plant their can of food was processed from!!!<br /><br />Don't let your cat become so finicky by feeding only one brand or flavor or variety consistently for years.  Mix it up.  Wellness may be the best, but there are several high-quality brands of canned cat food on the market in the U.S. today -- look into them.<br /><br />I highly recommend rotating a few brands of high-quality canned foods if you have any problems with feeding Wellness to your cat, and even if you're not. Wellness is still a great brand of food (the best in my opinion), still containing the same high-quality ingredients as it ever did.  My cat loves it and I feed several flavors (Chicken, Beef & Chicken, Turkey) as part of his rotation."

As my tastes refined in adulthood, I was less inclined to buy bags of those chips that resembled styrofoam even if I still craved their sugary sweet and salty flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips Sweet Potato chips are the adult version of the snack I grew up with. There's a delicious sweet and salty mix in every bite.  The chip is light and airy, without resembling a foamy rice cake and the deep orange hue is the color of a perfectly roasted sweet potato.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of sweet potato chips from Amazon in the past (Both the ""Terra"" & ""Food Should Taste Good"" chips) which have all been good, but they didn't play up the sweet and salty combo quite as much as I'd like. The Terra chips are more like simple sliced sweet potatoes, oven dried and turned into chips; the Food Should Taste Good chips are like yummy, sweet potato flavored, salty tortilla chips; and these Pop Chips sweet potato chips are, well... sweet potato pop chips.  If you've never had a pop chip before, the weight of an individual chip probably most resembles Baked Lays - but with a puckered, air-puffed texture.<br /><br />There are 100 calories per bag.  24 bags come nicely packed in a box that you can tear open for a neat display in your pantry.  I've purchased bagged chips online a number of times and have received packages where the chips were thrown into a box which was thrown into an Amazon box for shipping so by the time they got to me, all the chips were broken.  Not so with this packaging, they're tightly packed so the the bags don't shift around much in shipping and the few bags we've already eaten have had no more broken chips than what we'd get from picking up a bag in the store.<br /><br />Happy snacking!"

This brand of Muesli tastes much better than plain oatmeal without sugar. I use the following recipe:<br /><br />1/3 cup Muesli<br /><br />3 T Meyenberg Evaporated Goat Milk: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY5COG"">Meyenberg Evaporated Goat Milk, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />1/3 cup water<br /><br />1 T sugar<br /><br />I mix the ingredients with a spoon in a glass jar that has a plastic lid (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141B6LQ"">Luminarc Working Glass 21 oz w/Red Lid, Set of 4</a>). I leave it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 24 hours. I find that it tastes best if it sits for at least 12 hours. As a final note the bags were much smaller than I expected because I considered how large 40 ounces of oatmeal would be but I guess the addition of the dried fruit and nuts adds weight, so the package is slightly less than half of a 40 ounce can of oatmeal."

I dislike malt but LOVE this mix!<br /><br />It's super easy - container says add water, egg & butter.  I have used milk in place of the water and find the taste better but found that they brown less evenly.  Either way they taste great.<br /><br />All you do is heat the waffle iron. Mix the 4 ingredients and in under 5 minutes you have a super tasty waffle.<br /><br />I have found that the thinner the batter the crispier the 'crust' is and the custardy-ier (wow!) the inside is, while the thicker the batter the more uniform texture. These don't have that cake texture like some mixes do - these are like waffles you get at a hotel or restaraunt.<br /><br />Not overly sweet.

I can present the following description as evidence that it is very well received by my very finicky cats. My purebred Manx cats are served a canned treat each evening that they look forward to very much. In fact, if it is late, they get very demanding and will remind me by very overt actions that ""excuse us...but...dinner has not been served at it's usual time!"". I divide three different cans of food each evening so that they have three different types/flavors of food on their plate. When I put the food down in front of them, the same thing happens every night. They will sniff all three choices and then eat the one that they like the best first. Each time that I serve the Tiki cat canned food as one of the choices it is the first food that they consume and not one bite of it is ever left over. Additionally, as far as my objective observations go, I find that the quality of the food is very good. I certainly plan to purchase more of this product in the future and I will purchase it from Amazon as that is where I found the best prices."

The flavoring of the herbs in the sauce were simply robust and just delicious, complimenting my other ingredients extremely well. I vowed never to buy commercial pasta sauces ever again, but this certainly changed my mind. This is very close to making a sauce from scratch, in my opinion.

B0057FT3II,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,AC,3,3,5,2012-04-12,Brownie mixes are NOT all alike,"Truly homemade brownies are great, of course, but there are times (more than I care to admit) when I suddenly have a craving for some chocolate, & the brownie form thereof is preferred, but I simply don't care to take the time & engage in the effort associated with 'from scratch' (besides, I don't always have the chocolate [let alone various other] ingredients for such on hand [& to an extent, that's intentional]).<br /><br />So, what 'feeding a brownie craving' usually comes down to, for me, is to grab a box of this terrific brownie mix (& no other, at this point [it's simply that good]), throw in the specified egg, vegetable oil, & water, & then after stirring, I pour it into what I now think of as a 'magic', insulated, small, (& non-stick) square metal pan (& for what it's worth, I do notice a definite 'optimized' outcome when baking this in an insulated pan), & then partake of the delicious goodness approximately 40 minutes later (I bake it for 33 minutes [extra time due to the type of pan], turn off the oven & let them stay in for another 2 minutes, & then after approximately 5 minutes outside of the oven, I take a silicone spatula to it, & 'begin extracting' ;) [an interesting 'benefit' to marking the pieces with a somewhat firm & relatively slim silicone spatula, is that it 'wraps' the top 'edges' slightly, so there are no crumb-like anythings which get separated from the piece, & to boot, the top edges of the pieces end up looking more 'neat' (though don't get me wrong, I also love the more 'crisp-ish'-along-the-top -type 'edge' often found with homemade brownies, & that often have a kind of looks-like-the-top-of-a-pie-crust -type top layer)]).<br /><br />For my first taste, I don't wait for these to completely cool (nowhere near), & despite my removing the first piece only ~5 minutes post-oven, the piece stays together (enough for 'transport', & with 'help'/support from the silicone spatula) (& vs. being a kind of semi-solid that breaks up like crazy wherever pressure occurred during 'lift-off'), & the cohesion isn't stiff, & it's not lava-like -- it's got that recognizable moist aspect that gives it a ~cake-like appeal (though it ends up having a 'thicker' texture than a cake would [these are brownies, afterall]).<br /><br />Honestly, I marvel at both the taste & texture of the brownies made from this mix -- they're terrific, & I'd prefer these brownies to most others, without a doubt (& yes, I'm also including 'from scratch' homemade, when I say that) -- the outcome produced in conjunction with this mix is close to the perfect balance for me of the major 'factors' associated with the 'brownie experience' -- namely, a wonderful & chocolatey-fudge taste, a moist & 'just right' chewy texture, & importantly, the repeatability of my being able to 'reproduce' the result over & over, each time I utilize the mix.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot overstate the importance of that insulated metal pan to the delectably optimized outcome I've experienced with this mix -- I've baked this with a glass pan, & with a standard metal pan, as well, & although the brownies tasted very good, the result from those wasn't as 'even' as that found with an insulated metal pan, & they were definitely not as moist (though their extra chewiness was also welcome, & if I let the insulated pan -made brownies cool long enough, they also have a chewiness that differs from the hot-off-the-presses outcome I am at times partial to, & seem to simply 'go for' when in the throes of a brownie craving [part of the reason for which is that this more cake-like brownie experience (in cutting a few pieces while still quite warm [though not steaming hot] ends up making for a great base beneath the all natural canned-in-a-jar cherry pie mix topping that has become a yummy addition for any while-still-quite-warm brownie slices I decide to enjoy 'first' [& when I have any of the brownie slices in their otherwise preferred 'au natural' form, they taste terrific whether still warm, or whether cooled & at room temp, & whether same day or next]).<br /><br />The manufacturer of this product has kept the 'customer contribution to the mix composition' aspect to a minimum, but not at the expense of the mix subsequently having a bunch of artificial whatnot in the place of would-be-used-with-a-scratch-recipe ingredients (although, to be clear, the cocoa powder used in the mix does get 'fancied up' a tad, what with the manufacturer also including some powdered sugar in the mix [& I mention this only to point out that although it isn't 'artificial', it isn't always included by folks in a to-make-from-scratch brownie recipe (regardless, if it's part of the ingredient 'choir' of this mix, & knowing what I do about the outcome, I appreciate its 'voice')]).<br /><br />The picture associated with this listing of the product doesn't happen to show what is printed on the very top (you can see a hint of such, though it's hard to read in the existing image), but what it says is, ""Premium Brownie Mix"" & then beneath that, ""No Preservatives"".<br /><br />The brownies I make from this mix -- & which I bake (& exclusively, at this point) in an insulated metal pan (I truly cannot overstate the importance of this aspect, or the amazing difference that this pan makes) do not end up in any way reminding me of what I have come to think of as a 'made from a box' taste (or 'look') otherwise typically encountered with off-a-shelf boxed mixes.  The magic produced by pairing this mix, & the minimal additional ingredients called for, with an insulated metal pan, results in something that many might think was homemade, but regardless, many would find to be delicious.<br /><br />With all due respect to -- and in addition to how much I love -- the wonderful homemade brownies made by my grandmother, & by my mother, I hereby profess food-love for the brownies I can make with this mix..."

I went in not expecting to like it much though.<br /><br />So, I pulled out my boyfriend's tiny coffee pot to brew up some of this coffee.  The first thing that struck me as nice was that each packet of coffee is individually sealed, and each packet is contained in its own little filter (which is very convenient).  When I first brewed up a batch, I accidentally brewed it too weak (I made about 4 cups when the directions say to only make 1 cup).  I liked it a lot anyway; it reminded me of my favorite blend of carob tea.  To be fair to the coffee, though, I decided to brew it again following the directions properly.  It came out stronger (and I didn't enjoy the coffee bitterness as much) but it was still good.  I was able to drink it with only sugar and no creamer to dilute it's flavor.  I must say that in my limited experience, this is the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I think that I much prefer a light brew coffee.<br /><br />So, this is a great coffee for people who don't normally drink coffee.  Would a coffee lover actually enjoy it?  Well, if you like a really strong bitter coffee, then you really wouldn't care for this.  If you like a light or medium strength coffee, then you'll really love this one.  If you are just starting out with coffee drinking, this would be a good one to try out to ease you into it.  I liked it well enough that I'd even consider drinking it regularly along with my tea!  So, if any of this sounds appealing to you, go ahead and give it a try!"

(Stay away from the Ener-G brand, in my opinion)<br /><br />I have been gluten free for 3 weeks now, and seriously craving bread products.  I made some pancakes this morning from this product, and wow!!  very tasty, very light, I needed to thin them a bit more to have them spread correctly, but, this was the first real carb product that was ""bread like"" that I have eaten in 3 weeks.  Needless to say, I ate too many, and now have a carb headache!  :)<br /><br />Seriously though, this product, used in moderation, may help you not miss your gluten products quite as much.  I look forward to making bisquits and some of the other recipes on the box.<br />Way to go on this product, -it strikes a home run in the gluten free market."

I love the variety of flavors and the quality of flavor and texture.  In fact, the only flavors I don't like are licorice and sizzling cinnamon!  The one thing I don't love about Jelly Bellies is the price.  I was really excited to learn about Belly Flops, especially available on Amazon.<br /><br />I've now ordered several bags of Belly Flops, and every one has been fresh and tasty.  I find that all of the bags have had a wide variety of flavors, though of course the flavor distribution varies by batch.  The last batch was heavy on the kiwi and tangerine, which are two of my favorites.  Another batch had quite a few of the Coldstone flavors, which I had not tried, but enjoyed.  Each bag had some of the sours included, and one had some of the super fruit blend.  I love the differences in each bag, it's fun to see what you end up with.  I wish they would screw up more caramel corn beans, though... they're my favorite and I've only found a few in my Belly Flops so far. :)<br /><br />The beans taste just as good as regular jelly bellies. Many are double beans, which are my favorite...others are just slightly misshapen or don't have the jelly belly stamp. I have had a few that were the wrong color - like the wrong coating was put on a batch of fillings.  The result was still good and fun to eat.  I will continue to buy Belly Flops to keep my candy jar filled. They're not only a great value, but they're fun and interesting and a great conversation starter!"

B000SDKDM4,AMKT0FCZQ11FZ,Friedman Sowell,5,5,5,2011-09-24,Exquisite; excellent quality for the money; LONG shelf life.,"This blend of espresso roast beans is one of the best, if not -the- best for the money.  I've purchased countless blends of beans in the Texas area (many were fantastic), but given the shipping cost and the settling of the beans, I found myself adjusting my grinder(s) more than simply pulling shots and enjoying the coffee.  With these beans I simply grind, tamp, pull, and enjoy.  With a proper grind, tamp, and properly setup machine, the consistency of the espresso as it is being extracted looks like warm honey and ""tigers"" perfectly.<br /><br />**Some of the reviews/comments here state that you must use expensive equipment to enjoy this coffee.  Though the term ""expensive"" is relative, you do not need equipment in the $2,000 range to enjoy this coffee.  A basic, pump-driven espresso machine with an accompanying burr grinder (no blades!) will produce an enjoyable shot.  Will a $3,000 espresso machine produce better shots than a $300 machine?  Of course.  Will a $300 machine produce a better shot than a steam-driven machine?  Oh, most definitely, but this is all irrelevant as the focus here is the quality of Lavazza espresso beans, and that quality is superb.**<br /><br />For reference, here is the equipment I've used with this coffee:<br /><br />Solis Crema SL70 - Stock - broken.<br />Gaggia Baby Class - Stock.<br />Rancilio Silvia (V3) - With 3-shot La Marzocco basket and bottomless portafilter - no PID.<br />Expobar Brewtus IV - Stock.<br />La Marzocco GS/3 - Stock.<br />Gaggia MDF Grinder - Stock.<br />Mazzer Mini Grinder - Stock."

I have developed horrible allergies on my hands (contact dermatitis/eczema). Nothing has helped in the 8 months since the symptoms developed.

Fafarman ""davefxx""",11,14,5,2011-10-01,Inuit-Style Treat,"According to two other reviewers: ""The taste is remarkably fresh for canned"" and ""The Japanese would describe it as Umami."" I quite agree with both of these observations. Some cautions, however:<br /><br />You can't just open a can and eat it as if it were a can of sardines, or even a can of oil-pack tuna. The product is extremely oily -- in fact, it is 60% oil (richer than triple-creme brie)! It happens to be a healthful oil with vitamins A and D and Omega 3 fats, but it is still a bit much. I compared the nutritional values to a somewhat smaller can of oil-packed sardines. The cod liver had less protein than one might expect -- 9 grams versus 16 for the sardines -- but off the chart on calories with 1165!<br /><br />To make matters worse, the instructions on the can (if you can read them -- they're in four languages and the tiny print requires a STRONG magnifier to see) say, ""Must be consumed immediately after opening."" I strongly suggest a skeptical regard to that. The ""remarkably fresh"" taste does change quickly even in the refrigerator, but the result is not unpleasant. A little fishier, perhaps. I kept some for over a week and it was still tasty.<br /><br />By the way, you ought not to waste the oil. It is of course sold separately as cod liver oil and is a fine nutritional supplement.<br /><br />So, I suggest a strategic approach to consuming a can. You don't want to eat it all at once (even if you have help), regardless of what the label says."

As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues. As magnesium pulls water into the gut, IMO it's the best remedy for sluggish elimination, and you must build the dose up slowly to prevent stools that are too loose.  For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.  Deeper and more refreshed sleep is also a main objective to any chronic pain condition.<br /><br /> I switched to the Osteo Calm a couple of months ago in my desire to add a better piece to my menopausal osteoporosis prevention, and have found that product to be completely awesome also."

Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a ""good"" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought ""stuff"", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!"

My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds.

This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time.

Better than fresh tuna I think. This is coming from me, someone who doesn't like fish at all. When I was little, and my father cooked fish, I started to gag and had to run out of the house, I hated that smell. I still hate that fishy taste. In a pinch, I will eat Albacore (white) tuna, but even that sometimes makes me gag (because I just am not able to stomach fish), and most of the can goes to waste, because I never want to touch it for weeks afterwards.<br /><br />BUT! Bonito del Norte (not necessarily this particular brand, which I do enjoy) is the champagne of tuna - it tastes so mild, and buttery, it has its own distinct flavor, in between fish and meat. Best of all is the texture, very firm and dense.<br /><br />When I was little, my family got to stay in my aunt's house in Spain, off season, when she couldn't rent it out to anyone else, and this was my favorite food: fresh baguette, and Bonito del Norte on top. A little bit goes a long way. You can spread a little mayo on the bread, and then put just a few pieces of this tuna on top, very sparingly (not like in American tuna sandwiches). It's the best. The taste is so exquisite, you can just open the can and eat it out of the can with a fork, without mayo. If you do use mayo, use very litte, as not to overpower the delicate taste.<br /><br />Wikipedia states that Spaniards call Albacore tuna (white tuna)  Bonito del Norte  That may be so, but the Bonito del Norte that is canned in Spain tastes totally different from the Albacore tuna normally available in the supermarket in the US, even the most expensive brands. Starkist sells a White Tuna in olive oil, which should theoretically taste the same as the Bonito del Norte in olive oil, according to Wikipedia, but that's not the case. The American Albacore white tuna has a much stronger, coarser taste. The Bonito del Norte has  buttery taste, which manages to be delicate and at the same time concentrated. Therefore a litte goes a long way.<br /><br />Yes, Bonito del Norte is always expensive, even in Spain, but I hope that you try to taste it just once in you life, which is why I'm writing this review.<br /><br />PS I have had fresh (very expensive) Ahi tuna in Hawaii, grilled. It was good, but still too fishy. I've made tuna salad out the leftover cold Ahi, with mayo the next day. That tasted better, nice and firm meat, less fishy than eaten hot. But for me, nothing in the world can touch the sublime taste of this canned Bonito del Norte."

It is not overly sweet, but is somewhat so--it has 50 calories, so that's a couple of teaspoons of sugar. I would prefer an unsweetened option, but this is not too much. You could easily make iced coffee with this--it has enough flavor to hold up to some dilution from the ice and could be pre-chilled to reduce that even further.<br /><br />Good stuff."

Since I hadn't seen preparation instructions either here or on Numi's website, I thought I would leave mine as a guide for first time chai preparers.<br /><br />Makes 1 cup in less than 10 minutes:<br /><br />1. Add 1 tsp of this tea to 4/5 of a cup of water.  Slowly bring to a boil (medium-high heat, should take a few minutes).<br />2. Add 2 Tbsp of sugar which should lower the temperature a bit, allow tea to come back to a boil for another minute or so.<br />3. Add 2/5 cup of milk (I use 2%, but whole is the best), allow tea to return to a boil (should take several more minutes).  NOTE: Keep an eye on this part, if the temperature is too high, the tea will easily rise up out of the container and make a giant mess when it returns to boiling :-).<br />4. Turn off the heat just as the tea starts to rise, and allow the contents to simmer for another minute or so.<br />5. Using the finest strainer you can find (there are some excellent stainless steel ones here on amazon), strain the loose tea from the drink and serve.<br /><br />There are all kinds of tricks to getting chai tea to taste the way you want ranging from adding fresh grated ginger during preparation to a little honey just prior to serving.  It's awfully hard to go wrong when you start with this tea but if it doesn't turn out exactly like you want, just tweak the ratios until it suits your tastes."

Allen Greenbaum,6,6,5,2008-06-02,Great Natural Taste!,"I've reviewed a lot of these products, and most have some common flaws: Bad, ""unnatural,"" or chemical-like taste (especially in the metallic after-taste), woefully stale, cardboard-like texture, high fat content, and relatively high price.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lara-Bars are perhaps the best tasting line of ""nutritional bars"" available. The apple pie version is nicely chewy, with a taste of rolled oats, cinnamon, raisin, and, of course, apple, though it's not as intense or satisfying a fruit flavor as their Cherry Pie bar.  The apple hits you especially in the aftertaste, which is very satisfying.  Perhaps a bit on the dry side, but neither boring or cloying, and without that awful artificial taste mentioned above.<br /><br />The ingredient list is all one needs to read to discover the ""secret"" of Lara's natural taste:<br />Dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon. That's it! This is absolutely unheard of in type of food! Go to any comparable product (e.g., Cliff, Balance, Promax, South Beach, etc.) and you will find a veritable mine of vitamin and mineral additives.  For that reason alone (OK, and the concomitant wonderfully natural taste), these stand leagues above the competition.<br /><br />Does this reliance on natural foods cost you in nutrition?  I don't know--that's one for doctors and dietitians. However, I can list the nutritional values here:<br /><br />In one bar, you ingest the following:<br /><br />One serving (45 grams) provides 180 Calories--90 of them from fat;  10 g, Total Fat, of which only 1 gram is saturated fat,  4 grams are monounsaturated, and 4.5 grams are polyunsaturated (no trans fat, although, interesting enough, those grams add only to 9.5);  NO Cholesterol; 5mg of Sodium: 280mg, Potassium; 23 grams, Total Carbohydrate. Of which 4 grams are fiber and 17 grams, sugar (all that fruit), and 4 grams of protein. IT also provides 1 gram of Omega-3 and 4 grams of Omega 6 fatty acids. The fruit content sums to 1 serving of fruit according to the USDA food guide pyramid (I'm reading all this off the wrapper).<br /><br />Vitamins: Vitamins A and C --0% (of the percent daily values, based on a 2,0000 calorie diet), Vitamin E -10%,  Calcium--6%, Iron--8%, Thiamin (B1) --4%, Riboflavin (B2)-8%, Niacin (B3)--4%, Vitamin B6--4% Folate--4%, Zinc--4%, Copper--15%, Magnesium--10%.<br /><br />Some additional information can be found at--where-else--larabar.com, a nice little website where interested foodies can read about the company philosophy. For those not so inclined to visit, I offer an excerpt:<br /><br />""Humm Foods, the creator of L&Auml;RABAR, firmly believes that the foundation of a healthy mind, body and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is healthiest and most satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state...<br /><br />HUMM FOODS [note: this is contrasted with ""junk foods""] ... resonate with energy in a whole, natural state. When consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive when consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive.<br /><br />You can expect an unmistakable urge to humm after every L&Auml;RABAR  you eat.<br /><br />Let the humming begin!""<br /><br />Writing like that tells me these people are--and I hate using this overused word--PASSIONATE about their product.

We have a white machine in our laundryroom & then bought my husband a black one for work.  Soooooooo I guess you could say we looooooove this coffee/method of making it, & medium roast is the best. I recently saw Douwe Egberts non-pod coffee @ a local gourmet shop & it was like $9 something for 12oz! Good to know one can get the coffee to use in a regular drip pot as well, however, @ that price, I guess we will just continue to have this as ""treat coffee"" via our machine.<br />All this being said, I would like to say that @ both Target & Walmart here in Buffalo, NY area stores, I can get the pods for $4.24 each. However, when Target in particular, wants to rotate stock, they mark it down to the wonderful price of $4!!!!! Needless to say, I buy them out, go to another store & do the same. That's almost $4 less for 6 bags than Amazon sells it for!!!! I encourage all of you Senseoholics to do the same & check out the above mentioned stores. I wish Amazon would stop reminding me it's so cheap, when they don't mark it down to Target's level."

I have mid-back length, curly, Caucasian hair and this stuff really hydrates and softens my hair. It doesn't make your hair look greasy or flat if you use only a little bit when you have some wild frizz.  For hot oil treatments I get my hair wet then use enough to saturate my hair.  After that I walk around the house with a towel on my head (so if I lean on the furniture it doesn't make it oily) until bedtime when I shower and wash it out.  So awesome!"

We also love the Root Bear Encore by Blue Sky. It tastes like real cola did, back in the days before P and CC adulterated it with chemicals and flavor enhancers. It does not have a heavy after taste, nor does it taste like cough syrup. Maybe they reformulated the recipe since the negative reviews were posted. But I also think that if someone is used to commercial soda by major manufacturers, which tastes nothing like REAL cola, root bear, cream soda or ginger ale, then they will not like this.<br />If you aren't sure about it, don't buy the 24 pack. Find it locally, try it, then buy it in bulk. And if you are not used to a chemical free, mainly organic, diet, stay away. Your tastebuds are skewed to crave things like HFCS and this definitely will affect your palate."

She is a hot tea drinker and had finished off her box of Eggnogg'n tea quite a few months earlier. She said she was looking forward to getting some more around Christmas time, because that seems to be the only time she could find this particular flavor, which she says is wonderful. It does smell nice, but I prefer coffee, not tea. Anyway, I was so tickled to find this on Amazon, and at such a reasonable price. I had some shipped to her with a little get-well note and she was so excited, she had missed this so much. I normally wouldn't review something that I haven't personally had regularly (I did try this quite a while back, just a few sips, but I was waiting for the coffee to perk at her house:) The scent and flavor is surely similar to the spices found in egg nog, which I do like at Christmas time,  but this is a dark tea, and when I do drink tea (rarely) I like the green teas. Smelling it, though, almost makes me wish I did like dark teas, but I don't even like iced tea. This is one of those teas she likes to have from a favorite cup, and sit and enjoy, not so much a grab and gulp sort of thing. I haven't actively looked for this elsewhere since finding it on Amazon, but I understand it is mostly seasonal and hard to find elsewhere from her experience. I am so glad Amazon carries this, and at such a reasonable price."

Izze describes their sodas as ""100% Pure Fruit Juice and Sparkling Water"". That's an exaggeration, as there are a few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks. But the description is apt in that Izze's drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas. They are lightly carbonated, not super-fizzy. And the best of them taste like fresh fruit. The Sparkling Grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans, because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice, but lighter and a little sweeter. It's a little tart. A little sweet. A little fizzy. Very refreshing. It's like drinking fresh grapefruit juice, only better. There's never any trace of sourness.

The consistency is smooth, a potential problem for a lot of cats that won't eat chunky foods.  I absolutely can not recommend this food more highly.

Sometimes there will be a great flavor with a good bite and sometimes a more mild flavor like normal cheese puffs.  If you want to be assured of a milder flavor try the white cheddar.  I don't like those - too mild.  Be aware that the oil tends to settle in the puffs on the bottom half of the bag - so the puffs on top of the bag are lighter than the ones on the bottom.

I feel that is a good amount of time to give a complete review.  With that being said, I could have reviewed this food after just one month of use and it would be the same.  I have a Dogo Argentino that weighs around 110 lbs.  She had itchy skin, hair loss, runny goober eyes, heat spots, severe and never ending ear infections and skin tumors (multiple surgeries to have them removed).  She was only a year and three quarters old when we started her on this food.  Our doggie dermatologist....yes, doggie dermatologist and our local vet suggested switching her to this food.  Boy did it change our dog's, and our, lives.  Within a month, without any other treatment...just by switching her to this food her heat spot went away, her hair started growing back, her eyes quit having discharge and we haven't had not one more ear infection or skin tumor!!!!  We could not be happier with this food.  She ONLY eats this food and she ONLY eats the treats of the same brand and make.  The price is steep especially when feeding it to a 110 lb dog, but the money we have saved in vet bills and with her being a happy dog it is soooo worth it.  The other option was Hills Science Diet from my vet with cost twice as much as this.  I am so glad this food has fixed my dog.  I used to buy it at pet co, but when I found it on Amazon I was thrilled.  No more driving an hour to the petstore and having to lug the big bag around.

The taste is very close...obviously it's not going to taste exactly like real PB, but for the calories you are saving, it's surprisingly on target. Also, when you eat it with other things, as most people do, you don't even notice the difference. I spread it on toast and topped with honey...and it was SO delicious!!!<br /><br />A 45-calorie serving is two tablespoons mixed with one tablespoon of water. Be warned, this makes quite a small amount of peanut butter. It is just enough to coat one slice of toast, and actually, I would like a tad more. So yes, this stuff is very expensive and you don't get very much."

The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip."" It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****"

One thing I've discovered is that there's so much salt in this soup I can make it half strength -- double the water that is -- and it's still enjoyable if a bit on the thin side.<br /><br />And, the chicken heartiness soothes my caffiene wracked nerves and keeps me going and going.

Many folk medicine traditions use the hibiscus flower to treat high blood pressure and liver problems."" ~Susan Aldridge, PhD, medical journalist<br /><br />The day after happening upon the idea of blending brewed and cooled Passion Herbal Infusion with orange juice, I found the lovely Tazo Iced Tea Collection. They have a recipe for Passion Lemonade and a Passion Tea Smoothie. I'm happy to blend orange juice, a packet of stevia and cooled brewed Passion tea. The taste is surprisingly good.<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips. Lemongrass and red poppy.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each experience, so as to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients.<br /><br />Caffeine Free. Since the scent of orange reduces anxiety and hibiscus blossoms are said to lower blood pressure, this tea is a wonderful calming blend.<br /><br />NOTE: Many of my health/herb books say hibiscus flowers are not recommended during pregnancy.

If you haven't used chickpea flour, just remember you don't want to taste it before cooking because all chickpea flour has an unappealing taste that disappears during cooking.

I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product."

You can definitely get through hours where you are extremely tired. Usually take it either in the afternoon to get through the rest of the day; small sip before a workout, half a bottle around 10PM when going out during the weekend. This product has a bit of an intense flavor - overall all of them do, so have some water ready as a chaser. This product will get you to a state like when you slept 10 hours and are bright awake and alert, however you wont have the jitters, shaky hands or anything like it. After the 5-6 hours it slowly fades away and you literally get back to the state you were at before taking this product - so there is no crash or anything. Aside from that your body will just extract this product after a bathroom run - it is not based on caffeine or taurine it actually works based on insane amounts of Vitamin B6 and B12 - one of them is at 8000% of your DV for food intake.

I'm impressed!<br /><br />Thought that I'd use the newer technology, being a Geek and all, so I purchased a couple of the kinds of spike- like devices that emit sound and dig a hole to put it in and walk away. Sadly, after *SIX WEEKS* I still had not got rid of the little beast. I don't like to hurt creatures and avoid killing anything at all but this was just getting ridiculous. I knew that it would be a real war of attrition. The longer it went on, the more my lawn looked like a vacant yard. The holes were popping up *EVERYWHERE* and I've spent hundreds of dollars on irrigation, sod and fertilizer to get a pretty stellar looking yard here in San Diego. If you have put a lot of TLC into making your home look good then you know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />So, I took the plunge and spent another $12 or so (plus S&H) and waited for the traps to arrive. I was dubious that they would work after trying the sonic and poisons. Meanwhile, I looked at several YouTube videos on how to set these up. Amazing what you can find on there, from how to build a rocket to sharks with laser beams attached to their heads ;-)<br /><br />Anyway, putting them in proved to be a pretty simple task. Watch the videos and follow the directions. A couple of key things: make sure that you set the trap so that the critter can't dig underneath it and bypass the trap. The thing with moles is that they're lazy so if you set it so that the tips of the trap are positioned properly, then you're golden. Also, a piece of string or some other way to secure the trap to the ground is *critical* as the moles can be quick and big so they can easily drag this trap back down the tunnel. Then you're really screwed 'cause you got a pissed off mole and you've lost one your new traps. So, make sure to secure the trap with a piece of twine/string/wire and anchor it to the ground.<br /><br />I'm glad that they worked, was really getting frustrated with my yard looking ragged. Not only that, but I have a Skunk who likes to dig up the Mole holes looking for his Dinner. UGH!!! But, that's an entirely different Product Review and story. Good Hunting!<br /><br />Cheers"

They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either.

This is the first coffee I ever tried in my Keurig and it's been a staple in our variety of K-Cups for two years now. The quality is superb - I wouldn't expect anything less from Green Mountain. In fact, a friend who has a relative who works there says the quality control is so strict they throw out cups that have even a tish more or less coffee than the cups are supposed to. At less than 0.60 cents/cup, this is a bargain. With Prime Membership, to have these delivered to my door is too good to be true."

The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

I found myself at first adding too much sugar and finding the coffee a tad too sweet a minute later as the flavors settled into one great cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you love rich, full bodied cups of coffee you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If breakfast blends and watery medium roasts are boring you, kick your cup up a notch, give it a try and fall in love with your coffee again."

Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say ""wow what smells so delicious?"". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!"

The local shop has been out for a couple weeks, and so I have come to Amazon to order some, as I can't wait until they get it back in stock.  The price was similar.<br /><br />I have been using this in my tea and coffee when I want it sweetened.  Unlike some reviewers, I found that I need much less of this sweetner than I need of sugar.  It does not tastes as sweet, but it has a taste/flavor.  And maybe that registers with me and so I need less?  I don't know.  I am also looking to consume less sugar, and am gradually needed things to be less and less sweet as a result.  This is a good think.<br /><br />I was interested in the idea that it is lower glycemic compared to sugar, and that it has vits/minerals, is GMO-free and vegan.  My doctor thinks I may be insulin resistant, so I am looking to drastically reduce sugar consumption.  But I still love to bake and cook.  As I said, I use this in my beverages, and I have also baked with it.  I made some sprouted grain zucchini bread that was delicious.  I substituted 1/2 cup of sugar for 1/4 cup of this coconut crystals.  It was sooo yummy.  Not super sweet but full of great flavor.  I also used it as a substituion in some sprouted grain cranberry pistachio muffins that were divine.  Again, I used half of the quantity of coconut crystals compared to sugar.  Flavor was great.  I am ordering here on Amazon because I want to try it with some cookies and see how they turn out.  So far, I am loving it!<br /><br />For those that are looking for healthier alternatives, I'd say give it a try.  If you want the super sugary sweet taste, this may not be for you."

Although that is not a very unique thing in our time, I tend to avoid some flavored coffees because they tend to get old pretty quick.  During the Christmas season, you see cinnamon, gingerbread and other flavors that are to remind us that winter is here.  These wear on me pretty quick and I usually loathe getting through the canister or package of coffee after the first couple of cups.<br /><br />This Vanilla Flavored Coffee is really a nice treat.  My wife enjoys the aroma as it brews.  She does not like the smell of some coffees, but this one is pleasant and it really tastes like it smells.  One thing I like too is that you can get a more bold flavor if you wish by adding just a little more than the recommended serving, giving it a Vanilla Pikes type taste.<br /><br />I look forward to trying more flavors from the Starbucks Natural Fusions collection.

She's healthy and lean, and her coat is silky and luxurious.<br />Maybe it's because I once owned a 96-pound Labrador that ate me out of house and home, but I cannot understand why people would think spending $1 and change per day to feed a pet is expensive...<br />For the price of a soda, you can feed your beloved pet a grain-free, quality cat food.  In reality, the junky, mass-marketed supermarket brands are a real waste of money, because you are paying for filler ingredients and added junk.<br />$1.20 a day is a bargain for the convenience, the quality, what it does for my cat, and how much she enjoys it. I certainly fitter away more than that each day on myself, in the way of ""indulgences""!<br />I know that the economy is bad and there are certainly a lot of people who have fallen on hard times, but for those who can afford to keep a pet in the first place, the cost of higher quality food shouldn't be a deterrent."

Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often."

No aftertaste, undertaste, or sidetaste, just 'good taste' - and it is hot, did I mention that? I use it on all kinds of foods, and it's a staple in my fridge. It doesn't really change the food taste much, which I like.<br /><br />One of my favorites is hot & sour soup, and add a heaping tablespoon of this stuff. Not recommended for the faint of tongue.<br /><br />If you have only a few kinds of hot sauce, this should be one of them."

B006JGHMX2,A1BMT1D7V3BOEY,Visionaerie,0,0,5,2012-10-19,AMAZING UNEXPECTED FLAVOR COMBO W/ OFFBEAT BRAND NAME,"There was always something intriguing about this brand of snack bars, and the unusual name is part of the mystique. Since I have tastes that are off the well-worn track, I finally took the plunge and tried out the dark chocolate fig bars. And I was delightfully surprised. They remind me of the old ""Apple Bakes"" bars that we used to get at one of those ""Big Lots"" kind of stores, which feature clearance products. So you might not get bowled over by this one's fairly humble presentation, since it seems to have minimal hype. But I really appreciate their simple list of ingredients, and here you get 90% fig in each bar! It's a very dense snack - not unlike a brownie. The box they come in is also a nice touch -- very practical and perfect for hiding!! It looks like they are also made in Wisconsin, so I am glad I am keeping my purchase money fairly local. Plus I have a close relative who lives up there! All in all, this bar (and the other tasty nutrition-savvy ones by the brand) is ""the road less traveled"" but definitely packed with satisfaction. I plan to savor this box for a while and use the rest for gifts. Looks like 2012 is going to end in an awesomely Oskri Christmas!!"

We have used the dreaded pill popper for many years. When the popper comes out, Andy beats a hasty retreat. We all hated it, as a lot of times the pills popped out, stayed in the popper, or he gagged on them. Since he had to have pills three times a day, it was a daily ordeal. It all changed when we tried Pill Pockets. He now looks forward to taking his pills. He loves the taste of the Pillpockets, I don't think we can now do without them. He likes them so much, we use them as treats for special occasions. They have made treating Andy a pleasant experience, rather than a ordeal. I wish I would have invented them."

When I add it to my rice, my rice tastes out of this world, and I just cannot get enough.  It's even worth the expensive price.<br />I hurt my rotator cuff, and it was sore and making popping noises when I moved it.  I googled & discovered that the other weightlifters had much success w/ fish oil.  I compared price per ounce of all the fish oils in the healthfood section, and they were all more expensive than this Red Boat fish oil.  Plus, I've bought those health-food fish-oils in the past.  They taste bland, sort of gross.  It seems like they try to hide the fishy taste w/ lemon.  It's rediculous!  Fish oil tastes great in rice!  There's no need to hide it!  I bought this stuff instead, and it tastes many-fold better than health-food fish oil, and it's cheaper.  I ate about 1/3 of a bottle on the first day I bought it.  The next day, the shoulder no longer makes popping sounds, and it's much better feeling.  Before I ate it, my shoulder hurt when I raised my arm.  After eating it, & a good night's sleep, the only way I can even  feel the sore muscle is by lifting the arm with a heavy weight.  Earlier, it seemed damaged, even after a good night's sleep, but after I ate this fish sauce & had another good night's sleep, it just felt sore, but only when lifting  a weight.  Now that's some great healing food!  ""Let food be thy medicine""  This is a potent elixer.  Very strong taste, but in a good way, & therefore, a very healing elixer.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I want to know if it has farm-raise anchovies.  If there is such a thing.  I prefer raw, & want to know if it's raw or ""pasteurized"" to destroy all nutrients, vitamins & healthy ""germs"".<br /><br />I've tried many Asian fish sauces.  Almost all of them have either added sugar, GMO-soy, or MSG.  And the taste isn't nearly as good as this stuff.  Squid fish sauce is pretty good, but not nearly as good as this stuff.  Squid costs much less, but Red Boat's quality, taste, and lack of additives puts it head & shoulders above the rest."

And the whole bag is only 250 calories.  Yes, the bag is small, especially for the price, but they are worth it.  I can't recommend these enough."

B000CSKKG4,AY12DBB0U420B,Gary Peterson,2,2,5,2010-01-24,Good Snacking!,"If you're ever looking for a light snack to accompany watching television, a ball game or something like that, try David Pumpkin Seeds. They're lightly roasted, lightly salted and all natural. And they're delicious!<br /><br />Some people eat the entire seed, but I only eat the kernels. Thus, I have to crack each seed, extract the kernel and dispose of the hulls. This process can be somewhat time consuming, but like everything else, you get better and better with practice. Still, some people would regard this as a negative, but I would regard it as a positive. I can sometimes spend all evening consuming a delicious snack and watching TV and consume less than a single serving which amounts to 280 calories. Plus, seeds and nuts carry a heavy caloric load in general, to be sure, but they also carry a lot of vitamins, minerals, unsaturated vegetable fat and fiber. They may have calories, but they aren't empty calories! I worry a little about the salt content, but the David seeds are only lightly salted and I don't consume the entire seed.<br /><br />These David Pumpkin Seeds are a fine light snack. Prepare to get addicted. I'll bet you can't eat just one, or one pack. They can be a little hard to find, but finding large quantities online is easy. Good snacking!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

I can't really say they are long lasting. I timed my dogs eating them and it took one 3 minutes and the other one 4 minutes.<br /><br />What I like is that these seem to be pretty good for our dogs. There are apples, carrots, chia seeds and parsley, among other natural ingredients in the bones.  There is no meat, just chicken flavor.

I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!"

Though Gabby and Piper don't hesitate to seek out and eat all kinds of yucky, unsavory stuff they find on the side of the road or in the backyard, I still like to feed them the best of foods and treats. Always on the hunt for those products with meat as the first ingredient and an absence of fillers and artificials, I recently discovered a food that seems to have a great pedigree and is worthy of our two girls.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this food. The first ingredient is organic chicken followed by chicken meal and more quality ingredients. Of course, I'd like to see a potato component, but we can't have everything.<br />I like that this food is designed for your dog's skin and coat, joints and bones, digestive system, and the immune system.<br />Our two dogs liked this food from the first piece of kibble. It's a food that's crunchy without being overly hard or too big for the little mouths of  Piper shih Tzu or Gabby Bolognese. Since Health Extension is a bit pricey, we choose to mix it half and half with their regular foods, Blue and Royal Canin."

When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!"

Prairie is a really good all rounder food. I like the variety, the balance of the protein and fat for the average companion dog,  and the simple list of ingredients.

I always check the sugar content on everything I buy and rest assured, I never, repeat, NEVER buy sugar.  That's where stevia comes in.<br /><br />This little Godsend in a bottle is excellent in tea and anything you want to bake.  For those of you who enjoy sweets, just use this instead of sugar if you are baking from scratch.  Box mixes don't count - they're LOADED with sugar.  Stevia in a bottle comes with a little eye dropper that makes it easy for you to regulate the amount of stevia you want to use.  You use a fraction of the amount of stevia that you would have used had you gone with sugar.  I consider stevia your passport to enjoying something sweet and something safe and natural."

When I started I was told I needed to start taking a protein supplement. So like every newbie, I figured GNC was the place to go. I was told to start using the wheybolic protein by the salesman so I did. However, it was becoming too pricey and I was getting headaches regularly. Shortly after, I read in consumer reports that there are various heavy metals found in the mix. I immediately began looking for a healthy and natural alternative. I found Nutiva organic hemp protein and decided to give it a try. It's been six months and I'm hooked. This stuff is great. It's organic (which is always a plus) and it is great for you. I am able to obtain lean protein after each workout and I'll even drink it with my breakfast in the morning to start my day the right way.

It warms me up during the cold and dampness and another added benefit..my stools come out much smoother..and constipation is usually eiliminated completely when I use it consistently.

You will not be sorry, do it, you will love it.<br /><br />My only downside here is that there are not too many blueberries, but enough. The blueberries are dehydrated, so they will not be as good as fresh (but you don't get the thermal bomb effect when you eat them). To make the most of the berries I recommend you let the mix sit for 10 minutes after you mix it for proper hydration. You will probably want to serve thse with fresh berries for the best experience.

The supplier through Amazon has better deals for the flavored varieties so this must be their best seller.I was getting the 24 oz delivered on a schedule for a little less than $10 a can but it became unavailable.

It also has Vitamin E, amino acids, mineral chelates, and some vegetables that are good for carnivores.  It doesn't contain any grains or meat by-products, but does have carrageenen, which I believe is a thickener, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with this product.

Any salt, when used in cooking, is essentially the same since it dissolves in any liquid, lending its flavor to the dish. However, when it is used right before serving as a garnish, the texture of different size grains and their composition will alter the basic salt flavor. This salt, when ground right on top of a food just before serving, is very flavorful and has a coarser mouth feel than regular table salt. You need to get used to actually putting on less salt than you would normally so that the flavor of the salt does not dominate the dish. Worth the additional expense, in my opinion."

To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The texture, which is between a chip and a rice cake, is a bit thicker than usual but has a very satisfying crunch. It also helps the chips to keep from crumbling too easily. The sea salt and vinegar flavor is the perfect combination of salty and tangy, and while these are quite filling, I don't fill sick after I binge on a whole bag the way I would with ordinary chips. I never liked baked chips much (the texture was just off for me) but I think I might actually prefer these to ordinary potato chips."

Yeah, I have 14xs the normal taste bud count and twice the depth, crazy but it makes me very aware of nuances for good and bad)... almond ones tend to have a grit; in some the salt and sugar (and cocoa in the chocolate ones) just don't ever quite join the nut blend... and no way am I drinking soy. This is PERFECT to carry with me when I am worried about temperature (so I keep a box of the 4 individuals around but actually usually take the whole 32oz one--I drink it in 3 sittings tops, usually the same day).<br /><br />Pacific foods also have amazing customer service; funny, I moved to Seattle from the east coast and having consumed it over a full year there, it suddenly was not known (the chocolate variety) ANYWHERE just a few hours from their plant in stores that have more Pacific brand broths, milks, and such than all other brands combined. They were awesome about getting it here for me (also before Amazon carried it); not sure why it costs so much with Amazon compared to a SEATTLE grocer since um Amazon is in Seattle, too, but glad for the backup regardless, hoping I never need to pay this much!<br /><br />Having had Pacific's oat, almond, hazelnut... And then Almond Breeze (the other good chocolate variety, sweetened that is, the unsweet isn't so palettable)... This is the best. The plain hazelnut milk is super smooth and great for making my own custom flavored drinks when I run out of my loved Alpenrose dairy goods (amazing milk)... This is definitely great for potential power outrages, winter storms... Great backup for perishable dairy goods! It is well worth $3/each, mind you, or grab the $28/case recurring and set it a few months away and see if you aren't hooked!! Seriously, bet you will be :) gonna go drink some right now (I should upload a shot of the cabinet shelf that is JUST 3 rows of this; 3-4 are always in the fridge cause it is so so good!)"

I've had her on EVO <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTJQN2"">EVO Red Meat Small Bite Dry Dog Food</a> & the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M2L23M"">Evo Herring and Salmon Dry Dog Food 6.6lb</a> For well over a year now.  I used to have to give her steroids every spring & fall. (Which I HATED to do!)  Her itching was so bad, that it kept ME awake at night!  I researched all kinds of dog food & dog food information I could get my hands on.  (I'm a Certified Dog Trainer & used to work as a Vet Tech, so I have a pretty good knowledge dog food knowledge base).  I found this book; <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1929242670"">Unlocking the Canine Ancestral Diet: Healthier Dog Food the ABC Way</a>, which is an EXCELLENT BOOK!  After reading it, I thought about making my own dog food, but decided it was not reasonable for me to do that, time wise.  The book has a list of recommend dog foods & I decided on EVO.  I'm SO GLAD I DID!!  SO IS MY DOG!!  It is now July 2012.  They've (I have 2 Jack Russell 'Terrorists', but only one with allergies) been on the EVO dry dog food diet for almost 2 years & I have NEVER had any issues with loose stools, the dogs not wanting to eat the food, etc.  In fact, the dog I have with the allergies is a 'picky' eater, but she LOVES EVO!  Especially the Herring & Salmon flavor.  Since I've been feeding this food, I've noticed that my other JRT has developed an ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL coat!  (I have one roughy & one smooth coat)  The smooth coat with the amazingly beautiful coat is due to the EVO.  It's even helped with the amount of shedding!  (Nothing can totally eliminate shedding, but this has cut down on the amount of shedding enough that I have noticed a difference!  I'm thinking that Josh Crick, got a bad bag OR, what I think is more likely, is was past the expiration date.  Also, (as you will find out if you read the book I recommended, which is just a thin little paperback, packed with info!)  You should NEVER take your dry dog food out of the original bag & store it in one of those bins.  Anything that can't be used up in 2 weeks time, I keep in the freezer.  This keeps the DHA in the food from breaking down & keeps dust mites & other little critters (that we can't even see) out of the food.  I CAN'T STRESS HIGHLY ENOUGH, that the expiration date, proper storage & just plain taking good care of the dogs food & plain old common sense, IS SO VERY IMPORTANT!  PLEASE read that book!  It's AWESOME & even has recipes in there so you can make your own dog food.  Also, reviewer Josh Crick stated that 1/4 of the bag he bought was powder, raises a HUGE red flag for me.  There has to be something either in that bag or something else wrong!!<br />About the price, everyone considers this dog food expensive, but with no fillers in it & depending on your dog's activity level, it takes a LOT LESS for the dog to get the nutrients he/she needs.  So you may pay more upfront when you first buy this, but if you store it properly, it will last much longer, because you feed so much less.  My smallest JRT is 15 lbs.  She is pretty active.  Living in Michigan's Upper Peninsula & only a mile from the northern part of Lake Michigan, I take the dogs to the beach to swim & they get to run loose in the woods, chasing all kinds of small mamamals, (yes, including skunks!), she only requires about 1/3 of a cup of food each day.  In fact, I have to watch her, because she tends to get a little 'chunky' now & then.  Personally, I think that this food is actually cheaper when all is said & done.<br />I hope this review helps!  I'll be monitoring this, so please feel free to ask any questions!!"

You'll often find me devouring a whole pizza by myself or inhaling several pounds of meat at the local Famous Daves. And when it comes cereal, the whole ""healthy"" section just seems like wasted space to me. I'd sooner eat 2 or 3 boxes of Lucky Charms in a week over a box of Total. All this was true until I was introduced to a fine creation known as Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Strawberries.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong. Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Strawberries hasn't changed my opinons on healthy cereals. In fact, original Honey Bunches of Oats is nothing more than some corn flakes and oat clusters that taste completely unoriginal. And unoriginallity really doesn't taste so great. Enter strawberries. Those old corn flakes and oat clusters remain here but added in are strawberries. Now, you're probably thinking the same as I did when I first saw the box. ""Uhh, probably just some crappy strawberry flavoring smeared on the flakes..."" This is not the case. Included in this cereal are REAL dried strawberry slices. Whoever thought of putting them inside the cereal should be given medal. They take the cereal from space-wasting-unoriginal-tasting trash to something that actually tastes GOOD... and it's healthy! The only downside to this cereal is that it's not as resilient when soaked in milk as other cereals. It will get soggy if you don't eat fast enough, but that's never really a problem for me.<br /><br />If you are a diehard fan of tooth rotting, chest pain inducing cereals, such as myself, you could definitely try this out.

Tastes as good as homemade,"I have been plagued with viruses & sore throats & sinus infections a lot this year. I'm not a big fan of hot drinks, but hot tea really does help soothe sore throats and helps sinuses drain, too.<br /><br />My favorite hot tea when I'm sick has been homemade Ginger-Lemon tea--heat the water, chop the ginger & lemon, put all in a teapot & let sit for 10 minutes and then add honey or sweetener.  It's great.  It tastes (and smells) yummy.  I would make it in big batches & put in the fridge to microwave by the cup.<br /><br />This Twinings Revive Herbal Lemon and Ginger tea brings the workload down to a simple heat water, steep tea bag, add sweetener. No chopping, no clean up.  No going to the grocery if you're out of lemon or ginger.<br /><br />When you are sick, faster and easier is way better.  This fits the bill nicely, thank you.  The taste is exactly the same as my homemade, too, and I was really surprised by that.  I was expecting it to be weak or either too lemony or too much ginger, but it's not.  It's very tasty.<br /><br />It's also caffeine free, of course, which is a good thing overall, but especially when you are sick and need to rest.<br /><br />There is a little overkill on the packaging.  The box is cello-wrapped, and each tea bag is individuall wrapped, too.  I don't know that it's necessary to do all that, but I'm sure it extends the shelf life considerably, and nobody wants ""old, dried out"" tea.  I think Celestial Seasonings has a waxed paper solution that seems to work and seems a bit more ""green"", but they didn't have this flavor.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"

They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!"

The hospital sent us home with a bunch of samples of a Name Brand formula. When we ran out and went to the store to get more, we had sticker shock once we realized how expensive it was going to be to feed twins. Unfortunately, I physically could not breast feed, so formula was a necessity. We sat down in the aisle at the store, pulling cans of the various formulas off of the shelf and comparing the nutrition labels. It was surprising to see that they were all just about the same thing, yes the Parent's Choice was half the price, and for a larger container!<br />We did a little more research about infant formula, and found out that due to certain guidelines made by the FDA, all infant formulas are required to be made nutritionally equal. So, we didn't have to worry about sub par nutrition, or having to use more to get the right nutrients, etc... It was essentially buying the same formula, with a different label/price.<br />In the course of a year of formula feeding twins, we saved nearly $1400.

B003VXE46Y,A1ZWM7T7R6MO02,JoshuaRM,57,58,5,2011-02-25,#1 Superfood,"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia seeds, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of Chia seeds, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the chia seeds have helped?  I think so.  I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia seeds, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price. Buy some Chia seeds and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible."

B008ADQOL8,A35GQN8V34YQUS,A. Diegel,0,0,5,2012-09-26,one of my favorite flavors!,"This matcha is great hot or cold. I think it tastes more like vanilla custard as a hot latte, and more like the whipped filling of a pastry when cold. Definitely great with milk! It also makes a great flavor for mixing with others. Peaches and cream, anyone? But even by itself, it's fantastic and definitely a must re-purchase when I run out."
B0037YXQMA,A14OQWSEOBZHF1,Netizen,2,2,5,2011-05-04,Excellent to have around ...,"It mixes easily with water or milk.  No blender required, though blending does make it frothy.<br /><br />It's a great emergency-preparedness item to have on hand.<br /><br />Tastes good, and even better if for some reason you haven't eaten and are famished.  If you have any insulin resistance going on, you will crash because of the high sugar content.  This is not great nutrition as with some of the protein powders, but with milk it suffices nicely.<br /><br />This is not a breakfast ""food"" per se, in my opinion.  It's a snack to tide you over, not a substitute for a meal.  Sending a kid off to school after only a serving of this would be unconscionable.<br /><br />It's more akin to a chocolate shake.  Makes a nice treat, or dessert beverage.<br /><br />It is what it is, and it excels at that.  No need to make it more than it is."

We both loved the stronger flavor of the spices.  To my dismay, on my next trip to the grocery store, the double-spice tea was nowhere to be found!  It was one of those items that apparently wasn't on their regular ordering schedule.  I looked it up on Amazon, and, there it was...six boxes at a time, on subscribe and save, a decent price, and quick delivery!  This tea is great with a ""sweetener of choice"" (I generally use stevia or agave in mine) and some milk or cream, hot or cold.  My hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his ""pre-sleep"" tea of choice.  I've also used 5-7 bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea (or, add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice).  Stash teas are great overall.  I like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a ""foil"" wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one's pocket or purse!  It IS black tea and contains caffeine!  If this is a problem, try the Good Earth Original Caffeine-Free tea.  Also available on Amazaon, it is a delicious, slightly sweet, cinnamon-y tea!"

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."

Each package is small and indeed makes me (probably you too) feel the item pricey, in comparison to other Miso products in Amazon.  But this can be compensated by a ""Free Shipping"" eligibility.  Other miso products from different suppliers often require a hefty shipping charge.  Not only that, 3 small packages as 1 would be better for keeping freshness, especially for those occasional users.  The taste is wonderful.  This miso is red so I expected some bitterness.  I usually choose shiro-miso (more lighter color miso) for sweeter and milder taste.  However, this red miso has beaten my prejudice against my red miso stereo type.  Oh, even though this miso tastes good by itself, please use it with sea weeds, fish stock, and / or ""hon-dashi"" when you make miso soup.  I am enjoying this!"

Her stools had been inconsistent, one day runny and the next day firm. She also had farts that were like WOAH (especially when on the Wellness fish formula). Once I switched to Organix, her stools firmed up and were consistent (and less frequent). She still farts occasionally (who doesn't), but not nearly as often and not nearly as bad. Since this is a premium concentrated dog food without all those nasty fillers such as corn, I don't have to feed my dog as much as I would with, say, Purina. She loves the kibble and gobbles it up every time.<br /><br />She is a 12 pound very active doggie, and the 15 lb bag usually lasts me 3 months.<br /><br />I have found Organix at Whole Foods and Petco as well, but Amazon is the cheapest."

It was not available in our town so a coworker was going to Texas and my husband gave him money to buy us several packages, we don't eat this chili frequently because it is spicy and we had to get it from Texas.  About 10 or 15 years ago we found it in a Dillons store here in town.  My husband has passed away but my son was making it for me when I could no longer stand to cook it, we have about 4-5 time a year depending on the weather.

There is an instant cooling sensation, a pleasant, smooth mouth-feel, and a thirst quenching ability you wish a soda had.  I've tried other brands, but they come across as ""raw"" or harsh; for me O.N.E. is the V.S.O.P. of coconut waters (to me, that means the best).

I've read through the reviews of this from the athletes, and if I were an athlete it would probably be a big deal in my mind.  On the other hand, I'm like everyone and get sick from time to time.  From being ill, I was dehydrated.  My doctor immediately told me to start drinking Gatorade or PediaSure.  I have never liked flavored sports drinks.  I hate the fact that when I am already not feeling well, I have to drink something I can't stand the flavor of.  I had previous tried SmartWater to solve this issue, but it doesn't seem to be infused with enough electrolytes to help.  So, this time I tried Essentia.  After about 2 liters, I did feel better.  You know that sorta dry, swollen tongue thing that happens when you are dehydrated?  That went away.  I felt a little stronger between drinking this and taking my medicine.  I asked the doctor if this was okay to drink instead of Gatorade and he gave me the go ahead.  So, here is what I liked:<br /><br />1.  It pretty much tastes like water.  There is a slight difference in taste from something like Brita water, or most bottled water, but overall it's not a taste that drives me away.<br /><br />2.  It is not sugary!  This is what drives me away from Gatorade.  I hate the sugary taste of every one of their flavors.  Since this basically tastes like water, it is not sugary!  This is the aspect that makes me dance for joy.<br /><br />3.  It made me feel hydrated after a bottle.  Honestly, it was probably less than a bottle.  If I wasn't already extremely dehydrated, it would have been even less than that.  I love it when something makes you just feel better.<br /><br />4.  It is a sporty water bottle that is made from environmentally safe products.  I'm not a total Go Green girl, but it is definitely a plus and something I am becoming more aware of.  I know that several of my high school athletes are very big in the Green shopping, so this is something I would recommend it.  It's also good plastic that is easily recycled again.<br /><br />The biggest con is the price.  It's not unheard of for a 12 pack of water to be expensive, but it is definitely not a drink the average family would be able to purchase several times a week.  A single bottle is just slightly more expensive than Gatorade, but a 12 pack for about $25 is much different than the supermarket brand of water that is a 24 pack for $4.00.  This is water that is for the electrolytes and rehydrating after a sickness or big work out, not an every day drinking water."

I don't know why these got so many bad reviews.  They were chewy, not hard, sweet, but not too sweet, and they have a decent amount of calories.  A lot of bars that you get that have chocolate on them, are about 140 to 150 calories.  These have 110 calories, and are 27 grams, which is pretty much the same size as most bars of this kind.  They don't have high fructose corn syrup, but they do have fructose and corn syrup, so that isn't a good thing.  These aren't natural as they are full of things you can't pronounce.  However, if you are looking for a sweet snack, these beat a candy bar any day.  The only thing I don't care for is that they don't leave me satisfied.  After eating one, I want another.  I find this is true with most chocolate granola bars though.  I agree with the other reviewers, I don't taste the peanut butter, I only taste the chocolate.<br /><br />I like to take these to work for my afternoon break, as that is when I crave a sweet treat, and these are much better than candy, as the calories are considerably lower."

Based on what I could find online I thought she was getting doggie Alzheimer's and I was scared. My boyfriend got this at a healthfood store and we started giving her 4 drops 2x a day (once with dinner and once at bedtime; she is approx 22 lbs). Right away there was a difference. She started sleeping through the night and seemed much more relaxed and herself. After only a few days she was snuggling again! I find it's easiest to mix in with food rather than in the water bowl so I can control how much she takes, plus we have 2 dogs and the other one doesn't need it. At bedtime I give them some unsweetened applesauce which they love and I just put her drops in that. This is a great price compared to the smaller size we got at the healthfood store, and I received my order earlier than expected. I definitely recommend this!"

The ginger added is candied ginger (sugar and ginger) and just the right mixture seems to have been used.  The sugar enhances the ginger rather than the other way around.<br /><br />The cookies are small and rich brown in color.<br /><br />Because of the quality and careful selection of organic ingredients (unbleached wheat flour, as well as organic sugar and palm fruit oil, plus the delicious flavor of molasses), I will be purchasing this product at my local supermarket when I'm in the mood for something sweet.<br /><br />I don't usually partake of cookies, but these are small and healthy enough to not make me feel guilty when I treat myself to one or two at a time.  Also my dogs seem to like the scent -- I had to tell them 'No'-'No' several times.  And, yes, I felt stingy.<br /><br />A serving size is considered to be five cookies:  so per serving size, these cookies contain 3.5 gr fat, 180 mg sodium, no cholesterol, 24 gr carbohydrates, 2% calcium and 2% iron.<br /><br />I'm impressed!"

I must confess, however, that I don't make or serve it as espresso. I put the capsule in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6UTG"">Kaldi S04 Single Cup Brewer, Red</a> and push the button for brewed coffee and that gives me the perfect strength when diluted like that. While the brewer is working, I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6V1I"">CBTL LM-145P Milk Frother, Black</a> to prepare my milk. When that is done I add a packet of the CBTL vanilla flavored powder and whisk it. HEAVENLY!  This has a very smooth flavor, their darkest roast - and is a great way to start my day without having to go to a coffee house and pay those high prices. If I don't have extra time or am in a hurry, I don't use the frother; I just add my favorite creamer to the hot espresso -- I prefer the International Delight Coffee Creamer, Caramel Macchiato, 24 Ct (Pack of 4).<br /><br />The capsules are about 60¢ each when you order through the amazon subscription service or you can buy directly from the online website of the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf company using their premium club and thus save on shipping. I do hope that these capsules will be available in my local grocery stores to make it more convenient for purchase.<br /><br />The CBTL single cup brewer, the CBTL milk frother, and this Italian Espresso used in combination make great coffee. You can experiment with all the different flavors and find the one you like best. You can make coffee drinks just as good as any barista!"
