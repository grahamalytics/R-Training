# R Training (Introductory)

## About
The markdown files and R scripts in this repository were written for and delivered during a 3-day *Introduction to R* training for Brierley+Partner's Customer Insights & Analytics team. 
The training originally occurred during one week in April 2017 as part of Brierley's planned organizational technology shift from SAS to R. At the time of training, I had been using R
regularly for over one-year and was excited to spread the joys and wonders of open source.

Brierley+Partner's is a global Loyalty & CRM innovator and agency which began in 1985 with the design of the Hilton HHonors program. For more information on the technology and consulting services
Brierley provides please visit their [website](https://www.brierley.com/) for more information.
